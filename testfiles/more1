this string is becoming to get bigger To enable minigrep to read the values of command line arguments we pass to it, we’ll need the std::env::args function provided in Rust’s standard library. This function returns an iterator of the command line arguments passed to minigrep. We’ll cover iterators fully in Chapter 13. For now, you only need to know two details about iterators: iterators produce a series of values, and we can call the collect method on an iterator to turn it into a collection, such as a vector, that contains all the elements the iterator produces. The code in Listing 12-1 allows your minigrep program to read any command line arguments passed to it, and then collect the values into a vector. Filename: src/main.rs
