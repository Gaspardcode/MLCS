PREFACE  TO  THE  REVISED  EDITION 


The  sea  has  always  challenged  the  minds  and  imagination  of 
men  and  even  today  it  remains  the  last  great  frontier  of  Earth. 
It  is  a  realm  so  vast  and  so  difficult  of  access  that  with  all  our 
efforts  we  have  explored  only  a  small  fraction  of  its  area.  Not 
even  the  mighty  technological  developments  of  this,  the  Atomic 
Age,  have  greatly  changed  this  situation.  The  awakening  of 
active  interest  in  the  exploration  of  the  sea  came  during  the 
Second  World  War,  when  it  became  clear  that  our  knowledge 
of  the  ocean  was  dangerously  inadequate.  We  had  only  the  most 
rudimentary  notions  of  the  geography  of  that  undersea  world 
over  which  our  ships  sailed  and  through  which  submarines 
moved.  We  knew  even  less  about  the  dynamics  of  the  sea  in 
motion,  although  the  ability  to  predict  the  actions  of  tides  and 
currents  and  waves  might  easily  determine  the  success  or  failure 
of  military  undertakings.  The  practical  need  having  been  so 
clearly  established,  the  governments  of  the  United  States  and  of 
other  leading  sea  powers  began  to  devote  increasing  effort  to  the 
scientific  study  of  the  sea.  Instruments  and  equipment,  most  of 
which  had  been  born  of  urgent  necessity,  gave  oceanographers 
the  means  of  tracing  the  contours  of  the  ocean  bottom,  of  study¬ 
ing  the  movements  of  deep  waters,  and  even  of  sampling  the  sea 
floor  itself. 

These  vastly  accelerated  studies  soon  began  to  show  that 
many  of  the  old  conceptions  of  the  sea  were  faulty,  and  by  the 
mid-point  of  the  century  a  new  picture  had  begun  to  emerge. 
But  it  was  still  like  a  huge  canvas  on  which  the  artist  has  indi¬ 
cated  the  general  scheme  of  his  grand  design  but  on  which  large 
blank  areas  await  the  clarifying  touch  of  his  brush. 

This  was  the  state  of  our  knowledge  of  the  ocean  world  when 
The  Sea  Around  Us  was  written  in  1951.  Since  that  time  the 


Vlll 


Preface 


filling  in  of  many  of  the  blank  areas  has  proceeded  and  new  dis¬ 
coveries  have  been  made.  In  this  second  edition  of  the  book  I 
have  described  the  most  important  of  the  new  findings  in  a 
series  of  notes  which  will  be  found  in  the  Appendix.  These  notes 
are  keyed  to  appropriate  passages  in  the  original  text  by  refer¬ 
ence  numbers.  For  example,  after  the  discussion  of  the  Arctic 
ocean  ending  on  page  63,  the  reader  may  go  on  to  learn  of  recent 
discoveries  in  this  area  by  turning  to  note  10  in  the  Appendix. 

The  i95o’s  have  comprised  an  exciting  decade  in  the  science 
of  the  sea.  During  this  period  a  manned  vehicle  has  descended 
to  the  deepest  hole  in  the  ocean  floor.  During  the  fifties,  also, 
the  crossing  of  the  entire  Arctic  basin  was  accomplished  by  sub¬ 
marines  traveling  under  the  ice.  Many  new  features  of  the  un¬ 
seen  floor  of  the  sea  have  been  described,  including  new  moun¬ 
tain  ranges  that  now  appear  to  be  linked  with  others  to  form 
the  longest  and  mightiest  mountains  of  the  earth— a  continuous 
chain  encircling  the  globe.  Deep,  hidden  rivers  in  the  sea,  sub¬ 
surface  currents  with  the  volume  of  a  thousand  Mississippis, 
have  been  found.  During  the  International  Geophysical  Year, 
60  ships  from  40  nations,  as  well  as  hundreds  of  stations  on 
islands  and  seacoasts,  co-operated  in  an  enormously  fruitful 
study  of  the  sea. 

Yet  the  present  achievements,  exciting  though  they  are,  must 
be  considered  only  a  beginning  to  what  is  yet  to  be  achieved 
by  probing  the  vast  depths  of  water  that  cover  most  of  the 
surface  of  the  earth.  In  1959  a  group  of  distinguished  scientists 
comprising  the  Committee  on  Oceanography  of  the  National 
Academy  of  Sciences  declared  that  “Man’s  knowledge  of  the 
oceans  is  meager  indeed  compared  with  their  importance  to 
him.”  The  Committee  recommended  at  least  a  doubling  of 
basic  research  on  the  sea  by  the  United  States  in  the  1960  s, 
anything  less  would,  in  its  opinion,  “jeopardize  the  position  of 
oceanography  in  the  United  States”  compared  with  other  na¬ 
tions  and  “place  us  at  a  disadvantage  in  the  future  use  of  the 
resources  of  the  sea.  ’ 

One  of  the  most  fascinating  of  the  projects  now  planned  for 
the  future  is  an  attempt  to  explore  the  interior  of  the  earth  by

drilling  a  hole  three  or  four  miles  deep  in  the  bottom  of  the 
sea.  This  project,  which  is  sponsored  by  the  National  Academy 
of  Sciences,  is  designed  to  penetrate  farther  than  instruments 
have  ever  before  reached,  to  the  boundary  between  the  earth’s 
crust  and  its  mantle.  This  boundary  is  known  to  geologists  as  the 
Mohorovicic  discontinuity  (or  more  familiarly  as  the  Moho) 
because  it  was  discovered  by  a  Yugoslavian  of  that  name  in  1912. 
The  Moho  is  the  point  at  which  earthquake  waves  show  a 
marked  change  in  velocity,  indicating  a  transition  from  one 
kind  of  material  to  something  quite  different.  It  lies  much 
deeper  under  the  continents  than  under  the  oceans,  so,  in  spite 
of  the  obvious  difficulties  of  drilling  in  deep  water,  an  ocean  site 
offers  most  promise.  Above  the  Moho  lies  the  crust  of  the  earth, 
composed  of  relatively  light  rocks,  below  it  the  mantle,  a  layer 
some  1800  miles  thick  enclosing  the  hot  core  of  the  earth.  The 
composition  of  the  crust  is  not  fully  known  and  the  nature  of 
the  mantle  can  be  deduced  only  by  the  most  indirect  methods. 
To  penetrate  these  regions  and  bring  back  actual  samples  would 
therefore  be  an  enormous  step  forward  in  understanding  the 
nature  of  our  earth,  and  would  even  advance  our  knowledge  of 
the  universe,  since  the  deep  structure  of  the  earth  may  be  as¬ 
sumed  to  be  like  that  of  other  planets. 

As  we  learn  more  about  the  sea  through  the  combined  studies 
of  many  specialists  a  new  concept  that  is  gradually  taking  form 
will  almost  certainly  be  strengthened.  Even  a  decade  or  so  ago  it 
was  the  fashion  to  speak  of  the  abyss  as  a  place  of  eternal  calm, 
its  black  recesses  undisturbed  by  any  movement  of  water  more 
active  than  a  slowly  creeping  current,  a  place  isolated  from  the 
surface  and  from  the  very  different  world  of  the  shallow  sea. 
This  picture  is  rapidly  being  replaced  by  one  that  shows  the 
deep  sea  as  a  place  of  movement  and  change,  an  idea  that  is 
far  more  exciting  and  that  possesses  deep  significance  for  some 
of  the  most  pressing  problems  of  our  time. 

In  the  new  and  more  dynamic  concept,  the  floor  of  the  deep 
sea  is  shaped  by  racing  turbidity  currents  or  mud  flows  that  pour 
down  the  slopes  of  the  ocean  basins  at  high  speed;  it  is  visited 
by  submarine  landslides  and  stirred  by  internal  tides.  The  crests

Preface 


and  ridges  of  some  of  the  undersea  mountains  are  swept  bare  of 
sediments  by  currents  whose  action,  in  the  words  of  geologist 
Bruce  Heezen,  is  comparable  to  “snow  avalanches  in  the  Alps 
(which)  sweep  down  and  smother  the  relief  of  the  lower  slopes. 

Far  from  being  isolated  from  the  continents  and  the  shallow 
seas  that  surround  them,  the  abyssal  plains  are  now  known  to 
receive  sediments  from  the  margins  of  the  continents.  The  effect 
of  the  turbidity  currents,  over  the  vast  stretches  of  geologic  time, 
is  to  fill  the  trenches  and  the  hollows  of  the  abyssal  floor  with 
sediment.  This  concept  helps  us  understand  certain  hitherto 
puzzling  occurrences.  Why,  for  example,  have  deposits  of  sand— 
surely  a  product  of  coastal  erosion  and  the  grinding  of  surf- 
appeared  on  the  mid-ocean  floor?  \Vhy  have  sediments  at  the 
mouths  of  submarine  canyons,  where  they  communicate  with 
the  abyss,  been  found  to  contain  such  reminders  of  the  land  as 
bits  of  wood  and  leaves,  and  why  are  there  sands  containing 
nuts,  twigs,  and  the  bark  of  trees  even  farther  out  on  the  plains 
of  the  abyss?  In  the  powerful  downrush  of  sediment-laden  cur¬ 
rents,  triggered  by  storms  or  floods  or  earthquakes,  we  now  have 
a  mechanism  that  accounts  for  these  once  mysterious  facts. 

Although  the  beginnings  of  our  present  concept  of  a  dynamic 
sea  go  back  perhaps  several  decades,  it  is  only  the  superb  in¬ 
struments  of  the  past  ten  years  that  have  allowed  us  to  glimpse 
the  hidden  movements  of  ocean  waters.  Now  we  suspect  that 
all  those  dark  regions  between  the  surface  and  the  bottom  are 
stirred  by  currents.  Even  such  mighty  surface  currents  as  the 
Gulf  Stream  are  not  quite  what  we  supposed  them  to  be.  In¬ 
stead  of  a  broad  and  steadily  flowing  river  of  water,  the  Gulf 
Stream  is  now  found  to  consist  of  narrow,  racing  tongues  of 
warm  water  that  curl  back  in  swirls  and  eddies.  And  below  the 
surface  currents  are  others  unlike  them,  running  at  their  own 
speeds,  in  their  own  direction,  with  their  own  volume.  And 
below  these  are  still  others.  Photographs  of  the  sea  bottom  taken 
at  great  depths  formerly  supposed  to  be  eternally  still  show 
ripple  marks,  a  sign  that  moving  waters  are  sorting  over  sedi¬ 
ments  and  carrying  away  the  finer  particles.  Strong  currents  have 
denuded  the  crest  of  much  of  the  vast  range  of  undersea  moun-

tains  known  as  the  Atlantic  Ridge,  and  every  one  of  the  sea 
mounts  that  has  been  photographed  reveals  the  work  of  deep 
currents  in  ripple  marks  and  scour  marks. 

Other  photographs  give  fresh  evidence  of  life  at  great  depths. 
Tracks  and  trails  cross  the  sea  floor  and  the  bottom  is  studded 
with  small  cones  built  by  unknown  forms  of  life  or  with  holes 
inhabited  by  small  burrowers.  The  Danish  research  vessel 
Galathea  brought  up  living  animals  in  dredges  operated  at  great 
depths,  where  only  recently  it  was  supposed  life  would  be  too 
scanty  to  permit  such  sampling. 

These  findings  of  the  dynamic  nature  of  the  sea  are  not  aca¬ 
demic;  they  are  not  merely  dramatic  details  of  a  story  that  has 
interest  but  no  application.  They  have  a  direct  and  immediate 
bearing  on  what  has  become  a  major  problem  of  our  time. 

Although  man’s  record  as  a  steward  of  the  natural  resources 
of  the  earth  has  been  a  discouraging  one,  there  has  long  been  a 
certain  comfort  in  the  belief  that  the  sea,  at  least,  was  inviolate, 
beyond  man’s  ability  to  change  and  to  despoil.  But  this  belief, 
unfortunately,  has  proved  to  be  naive.  In  unlocking  the  secrets 
of  the  atom,  modern  man  has  found  himself  confronted  with  a 
frightening  problem — what  to  do  with  the  most  dangerous  mate¬ 
rials  that  have  ever  existed  in  all  the  earth’s  history,  the  by¬ 
products  of  atomic  fission.  The  stark  problem  that  faces  him  is 
whether  he  can  dispose  of  these  lethal  substances  without  render¬ 
ing  the  earth  uninhabitable. 

No  account  of  the  sea  today  is  complete  unless  it  takes  note 
of  this  ominous  problem.  By  its  very  vastness  and  its  seeming 
remoteness,  the  sea  has  invited  the  attention  of  those  who  have 
the  problem  of  disposal,  and  with  very  little  discussion  and 
almost  no  public  notice,  at  least  until  the  late  ’fifties,  the  sea 
has  been  selected  as  a  “natural”  burying  place  for  the  con¬ 
taminated  rubbish  and  other  “low-level  wastes  of  the  Atomic 
Age.  These  wastes  are  placed  in  barrels  lined  with  concrete  and 
hauled  out  to  sea,  where  they  are  dumped  overboard  at  pre¬ 
viously  designated  sites.  Some  have  been  taken  out  100  miles  or 
more;  recently  sites  only  20  miles  offshore  have  been  suggested. 
In  theory  the  containers  are  deposited  at  depths  of  about  1000

fathoms,  but  in  practice  they  have  at  times  been  placed  in  much 
shallower  waters.  Supposedly  the  containers  have  a  life  of  at  least 
10  years,  after  which  whatever  radioactive  materials  remain  will 
be  released  to  the  sea.  But  again  this  is  only  in  theory,  and  a 
representative  of  the  Atomic  Energy  Commission,  which  either 
dumps  the  wastes  or  licenses  others  to  do  so,  has  publicly  con¬ 
ceded  that  the  containers  are  unlikely  to  maintain  “their  in¬ 
tegrity”  while  sinking  to  the  bottom.  Indeed,  in  tests  conducted 
in  California,  some  have  been  found  to  rupture  under  pressure 
at  only  a  few  hundred  fathoms. 

But  it  is  only  a  matter  of  time  until  the  contents  of  all  such 
containers  already  deposited  at  sea  will  be  free  in  the  ocean 
waters,  along  with  those  yet  to  come  as  the  applications  of 
atomic  science  expand.  To  the  packaged  wastes  so  deposited 
there  is  now  added  the  contaminated  run-off  from  rivers  that 
are  serving  as  dumping  grounds  for  atomic  wastes,  and  the  fall¬ 
out  from  the  testing  of  bombs,  the  greater  part  of  which  comes 
to  rest  on  the  vast  surface  of  the  sea. 

The  whole  practice,  despite  protestations  of  safety  by  the 
regulatory  agency,  rests  on  the  most  insecure  basis  of  fact. 
Oceanographers  say  they  can  make  “only  vague  estimates  of 
the  fate  of  radioactive  elements  introduced  into  the  deep  ocean. 
They  declare  that  years  of  intensive  study  will  be  needed  to 
provide  understanding  of  what  happens  when  such  wastes  are 
deposited  in  estuaries  and  coastal  waters.  As  we  have  seen,  all 
recent  knowledge  points  to  far  greater  activity  at  all  levels  of  the 
sea  than  had  ever  been  guessed  at.  The  deep  turbulence,  the 
horizontal  movements  of  vast  rivers  of  ocean  water  streaming 
one  above  another  in  varying  directions,  the  upwelling  of  water 
from  the  depths  carrying  with  it  minerals  from  the  bottom,  and 
the  opposite  downward  sinking  of  great  masses  of  surface  water, 
all  result  in  a  gigantic  mixing  process  that  in  time  will  bring 
about  universal  distribution  of  the  radioactive  contaminants. 

And  yet  the  actual  transport  of  radioactive  elements  by  the 
sea  itself  is  only  part  of  the  problem.  The  concentration  and 
distribution  of  radioisotopes  by  marine  life  may  possibly  have 
even  greater  importance  from  the  standpoint  of  human  hazard. 
It  is  known  that  plants  and  animals  of  the  sea  pick  up  and  con-

centrate  radiochemicals,  but  only  vague  information  now  exists 
as  to  details  of  the  process.  The  minute  life  of  the  sea  depends 
for  its  existence  on  the  minerals  in  the  water.  If  the  normal 
supply  of  these  is  low,  the  organisms  will  utilize  instead  the 
radioisotope  of  the  needed  element  if  it  is  present,  sometimes 
concentrating  it  as  much  as  a  million  times  beyond  its  abun¬ 
dance  in  sea  water.  What  happens  then  to  the  careful  calcula¬ 
tion  of  a  “maximum  permissible  level”?  For  the  tiny  organisms 
are  eaten  by  larger  ones  and  so  on  up  the  food  chain  to  man.  By 
such  a  process  tuna  over  an  area  of  a  million  square  miles  sur¬ 
rounding  the  Bikini  bomb  test  developed  a  degree  of  radio¬ 
activity  enormously  higher  than  that  of  the  sea  water. 

By  their  movements  and  migrations,  marine  creatures  further 
upset  the  convenient  theory  that  radioactive  wastes  remain  in 
the  area  where  they  are  deposited.  The  smaller  organisms  regu¬ 
larly  make  extensive  vertical  movements  upward  toward  the 
surface  of  the  sea  at  night,  downward  to  great  depths  by  day. 
And  with  them  goes  whatever  radioactivity  may  be  adhering  to 
them  or  may  have  become  incorporated  into  their  bodies.  The 
larger  fauna,  like  fishes,  seals,  and  whales,  may  migrate  over 
enormous  distances,  again  aiding  in  spreading  and  distributing 
the  radioactive  elements  deposited  at  sea. 

The  problem,  then,  is  far  more  complex  and  far  more  hazard¬ 
ous  than  has  been  admitted.  Even  in  the  comparatively  short 
time  since  disposal  began,  research  has  shown  that  some  of  the 
assumptions  on  which  it  was  based  were  dangerously  inaccurate. 
The  truth  is  that  disposal  has  proceeded  far  more  rapidly  than 
our  knowledge  justifies.  To  dispose  first  and  investigate  later  is 
an  invitation  to  disaster,  for  once  radioactive  elements  have  been 
deposited  at  sea  they  are  irretrievable.  The  mistakes  that  are 

made  now  are  made  for  all  time. 

It  is  a  curious  situation  that  the  sea,  from  which  life  first  arose, 
should  now  be  threatened  by  the  activities  of  one  form  of  that 
life.  But  the  sea,  though  changed  in  a  sinister  way,  will  continue 
to  exist;  the  threat  is  rather  to  life  itself.

The  Gray  Beginnings 


AND  THE  EARTH  WAS  WITHOUT  FORM,  AND  VOID;  AND 
DARKNESS  WAS  UPON  THE  FACE  OF  THE  DEEP. 

— Genesis 


U'EGINNINGS  are  apt  to  be  shadowy,  and  so  it  is  with  the 
beginnings  of  that  great  mother  of  life,  the  sea.  Many  people 
have  debated  how  and  when  the  earth  got  its  ocean,  and  it  is  not 
surprising  that  their  explanations  do  not  always  agree.  For  the 
plain  and  inescapable  truth  is  that  no  one  was  there  to  see,  and 
in  the  absence  of  eyewitness  accounts  there  is  bound  to  be  a  cer¬ 
tain  amount  of  disagreement.  So  if  I  tell  here  the  story  of  how 
the  young  planet  Earth  acquired  an  ocean,  it  must  be  a  story 
pieced  together  from  many  sources  and  containing  whole  chap¬ 
ters  the  details  of  which  we  can  only  imagine.  The  story  is 
founded  on  the  testimony  of  the  earth’s  most  ancient  rocks, 
which  were  young  when  the  earth  was  young;  on  other  evidence 
written  on  the  face  of  the  earth’s  satellite,  the  moon;  and  on 
hints  contained  in  the  history  of  the  sun  and  the  whole  universe 
of  star-filled  space.  For  although  no  man  was  there  to  witness 
this  cosmic  birth,  the  stars  and  the  moon  and  the  rocks  were 
there,  and,  indeed,  had  much  to  do  with  the  fact  that  there  is 


an  ocean.

Mother  Sea 

The  events  of  which  I  write  must  have  occurred  somewhat 
more  than  2  billion  years  ago.  As  nearly  as  science  can  tell,  that 
is  the  approximate  age  of  the  earth,  and  the  ocean  must  be  very 
nearly  as  old.  It  is  possible  now  to  discover  the  age  of  the  rocks 
that  compose  the  crust  of  the  earth  by  measuring  the  rate  of 
decay  of  the  radioactive  materials  they  contain.  The  oldest  rocks 
found  anywhere  on  earth— in  Manitoba— are  about  2.3  billion 
years  old.  Allowing  100  million  years  or  so  for  the  cooling  of  the 
eaith  s  materials  to  form  a  rocky  crust,  we  arrive  at  the  supposi¬ 
tion  that  the  tempestuous  and  violent  events  connected  with 
our  planet  s  birth  occurred  nearly  2V2  billion  years  ago.  But  this 
is  only  a  minimum  estimate,  for  rocks  indicating  an  even  greater 
age  may  be  found  at  any  time.1 

The  new  earth,  freshly  torn  from  its  parent  sun,  was  a  ball  of 
whirling  gases,  intensely  hot,  rushing  through  the  black  spaces 
of  the  universe  on  a  path  and  at  a  speed  controlled  by  immense 
forces.  Gradually  the  ball  of  flaming  gases  cooled.  The  gases 
began  to  liquefy,  and  Earth  became  a  molten  mass.  The  ma¬ 
terials  of  this  mass  eventually  became  sorted  out  in  a  definite 
pattern:  the  heaviest  in  the  center,  the  less  heavy  surrounding 
them,  and  the  least  heavy  forming  the  outer  rim.  This  is  the 
pattern  which  persists  today— a  central  sphere  of  molten  iron, 
very  nearly  as  hot  as  it  was  2  billion  years  ago,  an  intermediate 
sphere  of  semiplastic  basalt,  and  a  hard  outer  shell,  relatively 
quite  thin  and  composed  of  solid  basalt  and  granite. 

The  outer  shell  of  the  young  earth  must  have  been  a  good 
many  millions  of  years  changing  from  the  liquid  to  the  solid 
state,  and  it  is  believed  that,  before  this  change  was  completed, 
an  event  of  the  greatest  importance  took  place — the  formation 
of  the  moon.  The  next  time  you  stand  on  a  beach  at  night, 
watching  the  moon's  bright  path  across  the  water,  and  conscious 
of  the  moon-drawn  tides,  remember  that  the  moon  itself  may 
have  been  born  of  a  great  tidal  wave  of  earthly  substance,  torn 
off  into  space.  And  remember  that  if  the  moon  was  formed  in 
this  fashion,  the  event  may  have  had  much  to  do  with  shaping 
the  ocean  basins  and  the  continents  as  we  know  them. 

There  were  tides  in  the  new  earth,  long  before  there  was  an 


The  Gray  Beginnings

ocean.  In  response  to  the  pull  of  the  sun  the  molten  liquids  of 
the  earth’s  whole  surface  rose  in  tides  that  rolled  unhindered 
around  the  globe  and  only  gradually  slackened  and  diminished 
as  the  earthly  shell  cooled,  congealed,  and  hardened.  Those  who 
believe  that  the  moon  is  a  child  of  Earth  say  that  during  an  early 
stage  of  the  earth’s  development  something  happened  that 
caused  this  rolling,  viscid  tide  to  gather  speed  and  momentum 
and  to  rise  to  unimaginable  heights.  Apparently  the  force  that 
created  these  greatest  tides  the  earth  has  ever  known  was  the 
force  of  resonance,  for  at  this  time  the  period  of  the  solar  tides 
had  come  to  approach,  then  equal,  the  period  of  the  free  oscil¬ 
lation  of  the  liquid  earth.  And  so  every  sun  tide  was  given  in¬ 
creased  momentum  by  the  push  of  the  earth’s  oscillation,  and 
each  of  the  twice-daily  tides  was  larger  than  the  one  before  it. 
Physicists  have  calculated  that,  after  500  years  of  such  mon¬ 
strous,  steadily  increasing  tides,  those  on  the  side  toward  the 
sun  became  too  high  for  stability,  and  a  great  wave  was  torn 
away  and  hurled  into  space.  But  immediately,  of  course,  the 
newly  created  satellite  became  subject  to  physical  laws  that  sent 
it  spinning  in  an  orbit  of  its  own  about  the  earth.  This  is  what 
we  call  the  moon. 

There  are  reasons  for  believing  that  this  event  took  place  after 
the  earth’s  crust  had  become  slightly  hardened,  instead  of  during 
its  partly  liquid  state.  There  is  to  this  day  a  great  scar  on  the 
surface  of  the  globe.  This  scar  or  depression  holds  the  Pacific 
Ocean.  According  to  some  geophysicists,  the  floor  of  the  Pacific 
is  composed  of  basalt,  the  substance  of  the  earth’s  middle  layer, 
while  all  other  oceans  are  floored  with  a  thin  layer  of  granite, 
which  makes  up  most  of  the  earth’s  outer  layer.  We  immediately 
wonder  what  became  of  the  Pacific’s  granite  covering  and  the 
most  convenient  assumption  is  that  it  was  torn  away  when  the 
moon  was  formed.  There  is  supporting  evidence.  The  mean 
density  of  the  moon  is  much  less  than  that  of  the  earth  (3.3 
compared  with  5.5),  suggesting  that  the  moon  took  away  none 
of  the  earth’s  heavy  iron  core,  but  that  it  is  composed  only  of 
the  granite  and  some  of  the  basalt  of  the  outer  layers. 

The  birth  of  the  moon  probably  helped  shape  other  regions  of 


6 


Mother  Sea 


the  world  ocean  besides  the  Pacific.  When  part  of  the  crust  was 
torn  away,  strains  must  have  been  set  up  in  the  remaining  gran¬ 
ite  envelope.  Perhaps  the  granite  mass  cracked  open  on  the  side 
opposite  the  moon  scar.  Perhaps,  as  the  earth  spun  on  its  axis 
and  rushed  on  its  orbit  through  space,  the  cracks  widened  and 
the  masses  of  granite  began  to  drift  apart,  moving  over  a  tarry 
slowly  hardening  layer  of  basalt.  Gradually  the  outer  portions 
o  the  basalt  layer  became  solid  and  the  wandering  continents 
came  to  rest,  frozen  into  place  with  oceans  between  them.  In 
spite  of  theories  to  the  contrary,  the  weight  of  geologic  evidence 
seems  to  be  that  the  locations  of  the  major  ocean  basins  and  the 
major  continental  land  masses  are  today  much  the  same  as  they 
have  been  since  a  very  early  period  of  the  earth’s  history. 

But  this  is  to  anticipate  the  story,  for  when  the  moon  was  born 
there  was  no  ocean.  The  gradually  cooling  earth  was  enveloped 
m  heavy  layers  of  cloud,  which  contained  much  of  the  water  of 
the  new  planet.  For  a  long  time  its  surface  was  so  hot  that  no 
moisture  could  fall  without  immediately  being  reconverted  to 
steam  This  dense,  perpetually  renewed  cloud  covering  must 
have  been  thick  enough  that  no  rays  of  sunlight  could  penetrate 
it.  And  so  the  rough  outlines  of  the  continents  and  the  empty 
ocean  basins  were  sculptured  out  of  the  surface  of  the  earth  in 

darkness,  in  a  Stygian  world  of  heated  rock  and  swirling  clouds 
and  gloom.  &amp; 

As  soon  as  the  earth’s  crust  cooled  enough,  the  rains  began  to 

fall.  Never  have  there  been  such  rains  since  that  time.  Thev  fell 

continuously,  day  and  night,  days  passing  into  months,  into 

years,  into  centuries.  They  poured  into  the  waiting  ocean  basins, 

or,  tailing  upon  the  continental  masses,  drained  away  to  become 
sea.  J 

That  primeval  ocean,  growing  in  bulk  as  the  rains  slowly  filled 
its  basins,  must  have  been  only  faintly  salt.  But  the  falling  rains 
were  the  symbol  of  the  dissolution  of  the  continents.  From  the 
moment  the  rains  began  to  fall,  the  lands  began  to  be  worn  away 
and  carried  to  the  sea.  It  is  an  endless,  inexorable  process  that 
has  never  stopped— the  dissolving  of  the  rocks,  the  leaching  out 
o  their  contained  minerals,  the  carrying  of  the  rock  fragments 


The  Gray  Beginnings

and  dissolved  minerals  to  the  ocean.  And  over  the  eons  of  time, 
the  sea  has  grown  ever  more  bitter  with  the  salt  of  the  conti¬ 
nents. 

In  what  manner  the  sea  produced  the  mysterious  and  wonder¬ 
ful  stuff  called  protoplasm  we  cannot  say.  In  its  warm,  dimly  lit 
waters  the  unknown  conditions  of  temperature  and  pressure  and 
saltiness  must  have  been  the  critical  ones  for  the  creation  of  life 
from  non-life.  At  any  rate  they  produced  the  result  that  neither 
the  alchemists  with  their  crucibles  nor  modern  scientists  in  their 
laboratories  have  been  able  to  achieve. 

Before  the  first  living  cell  was  created,  there  may  have  been 
many  trials  and  failures.  It  seems  probable  that,  within  the  warm 
saltiness  of  the  primeval  sea,  certain  organic  substances  were 
fashioned  from  carbon  dioxide,  sulphur,  nitrogen,  phosphorus, 
potassium,  and  calcium.  Perhaps  these  were  transition  steps 
from  which  the  complex  molecules  of  protoplasm  arose— mole¬ 
cules  that  somehow  acquired  the  ability  to  reproduce  themselves 
and  begin  the  endless  stream  of  life.  But  at  present  no  one  is 
wise  enough  to  be  sure. 

Those  first  living  things  may  have  been  simple  microorganisms 
rather  like  some  of  the  bacteria  we  know  today— mysterious  bor¬ 
derline  forms  that  were  not  quite  plants,  not  quite  animals, 
barely  over  the  intangible  line  that  separates  the  non-living  from 
the  living.  It  is  doubtful  that  this  first  life  possessed  the  sub¬ 
stance  chlorophyll,  with  which  plants  in  sunlight  transform  life¬ 
less  chemicals  into  the  living  stuff  of  their  tissues.  Little  sunshine 
could  enter  their  dim  world,  penetrating  the  cloud  banks  from 
which  fell  the  endless  rains.  Probably  the  sea’s  first  children  lived 
on  the  organic  substances  then  present  in  the  ocean  waters,  or, 
like  the  iron  and  sulphur  bacteria  that  exist  today,  lived  directly 
on  inorganic  food. 

All  the  while  the  cloud  cover  was  thinning,  the  darkness  of  the 
nights  alternated  with  palely  illumined  days,  and  finally  the  sun 
for  the  first  time  shone  through  upon  the  sea.  By  this  time  some 
of  the  living  things  that  floated  in  the  sea  must  have  developed 
the  magic  of  chlorophyll.  Now  they  were  able  to  take  the  carbon 
dioxide  of  the  air  and  the  water  of  the  sea  and  of  these  elements, 


Mother  Sea 

in  sunlight,  build  the  organic  substances  they  needed.  So  the  first 
true  plants  came  into  being. 

Another  group  of  organisms,  lacking  the  chlorophyll  but  need¬ 
ing  organic  food,  found  they  could  make  a  way  of  life  for  them¬ 
selves  by  devouring  the  plants.  So  the  first  animals  arose,  and 
from  that  day  to  this,  ever y  animal  in  the  world  has  followed 
the  habit  it  learned  in  the  ancient  seas  and  depends,  directly  or 
through  complex  food  chains,  on  the  plants  for  food  and  life. 

As  the  years  passed,  and  the  centuries,  and  the  millions  of 
years,  the  stream  of  life  grew  more  and  more  complex.  From 
simple,  one-celled  creatures,  others  that  were  aggregations  of 
specialized  cells  arose,  and  then  creatures  with  organs  for  feed- 
Ing&gt;  digesting,  breathing,  reproducing.  Sponges  grew  on  the 
rocky  bottom  of  the  sea’s  edge  and  coral  animals  built  their 
habitations  m  warm,  clear  waters.  Jellyfish  swam  and  drifted  in 
the  sea.  Worms  evolved,  and  starfish,  and  hard-shelled  creatures 
with  many-jointed  legs,  the  arthropods.  The  plants,  too,  pro¬ 
gressed,  from  the  microscopic  algae  to  branched  and  curiously 
ruitmg  seaweeds  that  swayed  with  the  tides  and  were  plucked 
from  the  coastal  rocks  by  the  surf  and  cast  adrift. 

During  all  this  time  the  continents  had  no  life.  There  was 
little  to  induce  living  things  to  come  ashore,  forsaking  their  all¬ 
providing,  all-embracing  mother  sea.  The  lands  must  have  been 
eak  and  hostile  beyond  the  power  of  words  to  describe.  Imag¬ 
ine  a  whole  continent  of  naked  rock,  across  which  no  covering 
mantle  of  green  had  been  drawn— a  continent  without  soil,  for 
there  were  no  land  plants  to  aid  in  its  formation  and  bind  it  to 
the  rocks  with  their  roots.  Imagine  a  land  of  stone,  a  silent  land, 
except  for  the  sound  of  the  rains  and  winds  that  swept  across  it. 
For  there  was  no  living  voice,  and  no  living  thing  moved  over 
the  surface  of  the  rocks. 

Meanwhile,  the  gradual  cooling  of  the  planet,  which  had  first 
given  the  earth  its  hard  granite  crust,  was  progressing  into  its 
deeper  layers;  and  as  the  interior  slowly  cooled  and  contracted 
it  drew  away  from  the  outer  shell.  This  shell,  accommodating 
itself  to  the  shrinking  sphere  within  it,  fell  into  folds  and 
wrinkles— the  earth’s  first  mountain  ranges. 


The  Gray  Beginnings 


9 


Geologists  tell  us  that  there  must  have  been  at  least  two  peri¬ 
ods  of  mountain  building  (often  called  "revolutions  )  in  that 
dim  period,  so  long  ago  that  the  rocks  have  no  record  of  it,  so 
long  ago  that  the  mountains  themselves  have  long  since  been 
worn  away.  Then  there  came  a  third  great  period  of  upheaval 
and  readjustment  of  the  earth’s  crust,  about  a  billion  years  ago, 
but  of  all  its  majestic  mountains  the  only  reminders  today  are 
the  Laurentian  hills  of  eastern  Canada,  and  a  great  shield  of 
granite  over  the  flat  country  around  Hudson  Bay. 

The  epochs  of  mountain  building  only  served  to  speed  up  the 
processes  of  erosion  by  which  the  continents  were  worn  down 
and  their  crumbling  rock  and  contained  minerals  returned  to  the 
sea.  The  uplifted  masses  of  the  mountains  were  prey  to  the  bitter 
cold  of  the  upper  atmosphere  and  under  the  attacks  of  frost  and 
snow  and  ice  the  rocks  cracked  and  crumbled  away.  The  rains 
beat  with  greater  violence  upon  the  slopes  of  the  hills  and  car¬ 
ried  away  the  substance  of  the  mountains  in  torrential  streams. 
There  was  still  no  plant  covering  to  modify  and  resist  the  power 
of  the  rains. 

And  in  the  sea,  life  continued  to  evolve.  The  earliest  forms 
have  left  no  fossils  by  which  we  can  identify  them.  Probably  they 
were  soft-bodied,  with  no  hard  parts  that  could  be  preserved. 
Then,  too,  the  rock  layers  formed  in  those  early  days  have  since 
been  so  altered  by  enormous  heat  and  pressure,  under  the  fold¬ 
ings  of  the  earth’s  crust,  that  any  fossils  they  might  have  con¬ 
tained  would  have  been  destroyed. 

For  the  past  500  million  years,  however,  the  rocks  have  pre¬ 
served  the  fossil  record.  By  the  dawn  of  the  Cambrian  period, 
when  the  history  of  living  things  was  first  inscribed  on  rock 
pages,  life  in  the  sea  had  progressed  so  far  that  all  the  main 
groups  of  backboneless  or  invertebrate  animals  had  been  devel¬ 
oped.  But  there  were  no  animals  with  backbones,  no  insects  or 
spiders,  and  still  no  plant  or  animal  had  been  evolved  that  was 
capable  of  venturing  onto  the  forbidding  land.  So  for  more  than 
three-fourths  of  geologic  time  the  continents  were  desolate  and 
uninhabited,  while  the  sea  prepared  the  life  that  was  later  to 
invade  them  and  make  them  habitable.  Meanwhile,  with  violent

tremblings  of  the  earth  and  with  the  fire  and  smoke  of  roaring 
volcanoes,  mountains  rose  and  wore  away,  glaciers  moved  to  and 

fro  over  the  earth,  and  the  sea  crept  over  the  continents  and 
again  receded. 

It  was  not  until  Silurian  time,  some  350  million  years  ago,  that 
the  first  pioneer  of  land  life  crept  out  on  the  shore.  It  was  an 
arthropod,  one  of  the  great  tribe  that  later  produced  crabs  and 
lobsters  and  insects.  It  must  have  been  something  like  a  modern 
scorpion,  but,  unlike  some  of  its  descendants,  it  never  wholly 
severed  the  ties  that  united  it  to  the  sea.  It  lived  a  strange  life, 
half-terrestrial,  half-aquatic,  something  like  that  of  the  ghost 
crabs  that  speed  along  the  beaches  today,  now  and  then  dashing 
into  the  surf  to  moisten  their  gills. 

Fish,  tapered  of  body  and  stream-molded  by  the  press  of  run¬ 
ning  waters,  were  evolving  in  Silurian  rivers.  In  times  of  drought, 
in  the  drying  pools  and  lagoons,  the  shortage  of  oxygen  forced 
them  to  develop  swim  bladders  for  the  storage  of  air.  One  form 
that  possessed  an  air-breathing  lung  was  able  to  survive  the  dry 
periods  by  burying  itself  in  mud,  leaving  a  passage  to  the  surface 
through  which  it  breathed. 

It  is  very  doubtful  that  the  animals  alone  would  have  suc¬ 
ceeded  in  colonizing  the  land,  for  only  the  plants  had  the  power 
to  bring  about  the  first  amelioration  of  its  harsh  conditions.  They 
helped  make  soil  of  the  crumbling  rocks,  they  held  back  the  soil 
from  the  rains  that  would  have  swept  it  away,  and  little  by  little 
they  softened  and  subdued  the  bare  rock,  the  lifeless  desert.  We 
know  very  little  about  the  first  land  plants,  but  they  must  have 
been  closely  related  to  some  of  the  larger  seaweeds  that  had 
learned  to  live  in  the  coastal  shallows,  developing  strengthened 
stems  and  grasping,  rootlike  holdfasts  to  resist  the  drag  and  pull 
of  the  waves.  Perhaps  it  was  in  some  coastal  lowlands,  periodi¬ 
cally  drained  and  flooded,  that  some  such  plants  found  it  pos¬ 
sible  to  survive,  though  separated  from  the  sea.  This  also  seems 
to  have  taken  place  in  the  Silurian  period. 

The  mountains  that  had  been  thrown  up  by  the  Laurentian 
revolution  gradually  wore  away,  and  as  the  sediments  were 
washed  from  their  summits  and  deposited  on  the  lowlands,  great 


The  Gray  Beginnings

areas  of  the  continents  sank  under  the  load.  The  seas  crept  out 
of  their  basins  and  spread  over  the  lands.  Life  fared  well  and  was 
exceedingly  abundant  in  those  shallow,  sunlit  seas.  But  with  the 
later  retreat  of  the  ocean  water  into  the  deeper  basins,  many 
creatures  must  have  been  left  stranded  in  shallow,  landlocked 
bays.  Some  of  these  animals  found  means  to  survive  on  land.  The 
lakes,  the  shores  of  the  rivers,  and  the  coastal  swamps  of  those 
days  were  the  testing  grounds  in  which  plants  and  animals  either 
became  adapted  to  the  new  conditions  or  perished. 

As  the  lands  rose  and  the  seas  receded,  a  strange  fishlike  crea¬ 
ture  emerged  on  the  land,  and  over  the  thousands  of  years  its 
fins  became  legs,  and  instead  of  gills  it  developed  lungs.  In  the 
Devonian  sandstone  this  first  amphibian  left  its  footprint. 

On  land  and  sea  the  stream  of  life  poured  on.  New  forms 
evolved;  some  old  ones  declined  and  disappeared.  On  land  the 
mosses  and  the  ferns  and  the  seed  plants  developed.  The  reptiles 
for  a  time  dominated  the  earth,  gigantic,  grotesque,  and  terrify¬ 
ing.  Birds  learned  to  live  and  move  in  the  ocean  of  air.  The  first 
small  mammals  lurked  inconspicuously  in  hidden  crannies  of  the 
earth  as  though  in  fear  of  the  reptiles. 

When  they  went  ashore  the  animals  that  took  up  a  land  life 
carried  with  them  a  part  of  the  sea  in  their  bodies,  a  heritage 
which  they  passed  on  to  their  children  and  which  even  today 
links  each  land  animal  with  its  origin  in  the  ancient  sea.  Fish, 
amphibian,  and  reptile,  warm-blooded  bird  and  mammal— each 
of  us  carries  in  our  veins  a  salty  stream  in  which  the  elements 
sodium,  potassium,  and  calcium  are  combined  in  almost  the 
same  proportions  as  in  sea  water.  This  is  our  inheritance  from 
the  day,  untold  millions  of  years  ago,  when  a  remote  ancestor, 
having  progressed  from  the  one-celled  to  the  many-celled  stage, 
first  developed  a  circulatory  system  in  which  the  fluid  was 
merely  the  water  of  the  sea.  In  the  same  way,  our  lime-hardened 
skeletons  are  a  heritage  from  the  calcium-rich  ocean  of  Cambrian 
time.  Even  the  protoplasm  that  streams  within  each  cell  of  our 
bodies  has  the  chemical  structure  impressed  upon  all  living  mat¬ 
ter  when  the  first  simple  creatures  were  brought  forth  in  the 
ancient  sea.  And  as  life  itself  began  in  the  sea,  so  each  of  us 


*4  Mother  Sea 

begins  his  individual  life  in  a  miniature  ocean  within  his 
mother  s  womb,  and  in  the  stages  of  his  embryonic  development 
repeats  the  steps  by  which  his  race  evolved,  from  gill-breathing 
inhabitants  of  a  water  world  to  creatures  able  to  live  on  land. 

Some  of  the  land  animals  later  returned  to  the  ocean.  After 
perhaps  50  million  years  of  land  life,  a  number  of  reptiles  entered 
the  sea  about  170  million  years  ago,  in  the  Triassic  period.  They 
were  huge  and  formidable  creatures.  Some  had  oarlike  limbs  by 
which  they  rowed  through  the  water;  some  were  web-footed, 
with  long,  serpentine  necks.  These  grotesque  monsters  disap¬ 
peared  millions  of  years  ago,  but  we  remember  them  when  we 
come  upon  a  large  sea  turtle  swimming  many  miles  at  sea,  its 
barnacle-encrusted  shell  eloquent  of  its  marine  life.  Much  later, 
perhaps  no  more  than  50  million  years  ago,  some  of  the  mam¬ 
mals,  too,  abandoned  a  land  life  for  the  ocean.  Their  descend¬ 
ants  are  the  sea  lions,  seals,  sea  elephants,  and  whales  of  today. 

Among  the  land  mammals  there  was  a  race  of  creatures  that 
took  to  an  arboreal  existence.  Their  hands  underwent  remark¬ 
able  development,  becoming  skilled  in  manipulating  and  exam¬ 
ining  objects,  and  along  with  this  skill  came  a  superior  brain 
power  that  compensated  for  what  these  comparatively  small 
mammals  lacked  in  strength.  At  last,  perhaps  somewhere  in  the 
vast  interior  of  Asia,  they  descended  from  the  trees  and  became 
again  terrestrial.  The  past  million  years  have  seen  their  transfor¬ 
mation  into  beings  with  the  body  and  brain  and  spirit  of  man. 

Eventually  man,  too,  found  his  way  back  to  the  sea.  Standing 
on  its  shores,  he  must  have  looked  out  upon  it  with  wonder  and 
curiosity,  compounded  with  an  unconscious  recognition  of  his 
lineage.  He  could  not  physically  re-enter  the  ocean  as  the  seals 
and  whales  had  done.  But  over  the  centuries,  with  all  the  skill 
and  ingenuity  and  reasoning  powers  of  his  mind,  he  has  sought 
to  explore  and  investigate  even  its  most  remote  parts,  so  that  he 
might  re-enter  it  mentally  and  imaginatively. 

He  built  boats  to  venture  out  on  its  surface.  Later  he  found 
ways  to  descend  to  the  shallow  parts  of  its  floor,  carrying  with 
him  the  air  that,  as  a  land  mammal  long  unaccustomed  to 
aquatic  life,  he  needed  to  breathe.  Moving  in  fascination  over 


The  Gray  Beginnings 


*5 


the  deep  sea  he  could  not  enter,  he  found  ways  to  probe  its 
depths,  he  let  down  nets  to  capture  its  life,  he  invented  mechani¬ 
cal  eyes  and  ears  that  could  re-create  for  his  senses  a  world  long 
lost,  but  a  world  that,  in  the  deepest  part  of  his  subconscious 
mind,  he  had  never  wholly  forgotten. 

And  yet  he  has  returned  to  his  mother  sea  only  on  her  own 
terms.  He  cannot  control  or  change  the  ocean  as,  in  his  brief 
tenancy  of  earth,  he  has  subdued  and  plundered  the  continents. 
In  the  artificial  world  of  his  cities  and  towns,  he  often  forgets 
the  true  nature  of  his  planet  and  the  long  vistas  of  its  history,  in 
which  the  existence  of  the  race  of  men  has  occupied  a  mere  mo¬ 
ment  of  time.  The  sense  of  all  these  things  comes  to  him  most 
clearly  in  the  course  of  a  long  ocean  voyage,  when  he  watches 
day  after  day  the  receding  rim  of  the  horizon,  ridged  and  fur¬ 
rowed  by  waves;  when  at  night  he  becomes  aware  of  the  earth  s 
rotation  as  the  stars  pass  overhead;  or  when,  alone  in  this  world 
of  water  and  sky,  he  feels  the  loneliness  of  his  earth  in  space. 
And  then,  as  never  on  land,  he  knows  the  truth  that  his  world 
is  a  water  world,  a  planet  dominated  by  its  covering  mantle  of 
ocean,  in  which  the  continents  are  but  transient  intrusions  of 
land  above  the  surface  of  the  all-encircling  sea. 


The  Pattern  of  the  Surface 


THERE  IS,  ONE  KNOWS  NOT  WHAT  SWEET  MYSTERY  ABOUT 
THIS  SEA,  WHOSE  GENTLY  AWFUL  STIRRINGS  SEEM 
TO  SPEAK  OF  SOME  HIDDEN  SOUL  BENEATH. 

— Herman  Melville 


N  O WHERE  in  all  the  sea  does  life  exist  in  such  bewilder¬ 
ing  abundance  as  in  the  surface  waters.  From  the  deck  of  a 
vessel  you  may  look  down,  hour  after  hour,  on  the  shimmering 
discs  of  jellyfish,  their  gently  pulsating  bells  dotting  the  surface 
as  far  as  you  can  see.  Or  one  day  you  may  notice  early  in  the 
morning  that  you  are  passing  through  a  sea  that  has  taken  on  a 
brick-red  color  from  billions  upon  billions  of  microscopic  crea¬ 
tures,  each  of  which  contains  an  orange  pigment  granule.  At 
noon  you  are  still  moving  through  red  seas,  and  when  darkness 
falls  the  waters  shine  with  an  eerie  glow  from  the  phosphorescent 
fires  of  yet  more  billions  and  trillions  of  these  same  creatures. 

And  again  you  may  glimpse  not  only  the  abundance  but  some¬ 
thing  of  the  fierce  uncompromisingness  of  sea  life  when,  as  you 
look  over  the  rail  and  down,  down  into  water  of  a  clear,  deep 
green,  suddenly  there  passes  a  silver  shower  of  finger-long  fish- 
lets.  The  sun  strikes  a  metallic  gleam  from  their  flanks  as  they 
streak  by,  driving  deeper  into  the  green  depths  with  the  desper¬ 
ate  speed  of  the  hunted.  Perhaps  you  never  see  the  hunters,  but 


The  Pattern  of  the  Surface 


*7 


you  sense  their  presence  as  you  see  the  gulls  hovering,  with  eager, 
mewing  cries,  waiting  for  the  little  fish  to  be  driven  to  the  sur¬ 
face. 

Or  again,  perhaps,  you  may  sail  for  days  on  end  without  seeing 
anything  you  could  recognize  as  life  or  the  indications  of  life,  day 
after  day  of  empty  water  and  empty  sky,  and  so  you  may  reason¬ 
ably  conclude  that  there  is  no  spot  on  earth  so  barren  of  life  as 
the  open  ocean.  But  if  you  had  the  opportunity  to  tow  a  fine- 
meshed  net  through  the  seemingly  lifeless  water  and  then  to 
examine  the  washings  of  the  net,  you  would  find  that  life  is  scat¬ 
tered  almost  everywhere  through  the  surface  waters  like  a  fine 
dust.  A  cupful  of  water  may  contain  millions  upon  millions  of 
diatoms,  tiny  plant  cells,  each  of  them  far  too  small  to  be  seen 
by  the  human  eye;  or  it  may  swarm  with  an  infinitude  of  animal 
creatures,  none  larger  than  a  dust  mote,  which  live  on  plant  cells 
still  smaller  than  themselves. 

If  you  could  be  close  to  the  surface  waters  of  the  ocean  at 
night,  you  would  realize  that  then  they  are  alive  with  myriads  of 
strange  creatures  never  seen  by  day.  They  are  alive  with  the 
moving  lamps  of  small  shrimplike  beings  that  spend  the  daylight 
hours  in  the  gloom  of  deep  water,  and  with  the  shadowy  forms 
of  hungry  fish  and  the  dark  shapes  of  squid.  These  things  were 
seen,  as  few  men  have  seen  them,  by  the  Norwegian  ethnologist 
Thor  Heyerdahl  in  the  course  of  one  of  the  most  unusual  jour¬ 
neys  of  modern  times.  In  the  summer  of  1947  Heyerdahl  and  five 
companions  drifted  4300  miles  across  the  Pacific  on  a  raft  of 
balsa  logs,  to  test  a  theory  that  the  original  inhabitants  of  Poly¬ 
nesia  might  have  come  from  South  America  by  raft.  For  101  days 
and  nights  these  men  lived  practically  on  the  surface  of  the  sea, 
driven  by  the  trade  wind,  carried  on  the  strong  drift  of  the  Equa¬ 
torial  Current,  as  much  a  part  of  the  inexorable  westward  move¬ 
ment  of  wind  and  water  as  the  creatures  of  the  sea.  Because  of 
his  enviable  opportunity  to  observe  the  life  of  the  surface  while 
living  as  an  actual  part  of  it  for  so  many  weeks,  I  asked  Mr. 
Heyerdahl  about  some  of  his  impressions,  especially  of  the  sea  at 
night,  and  he  has  written  me  as  follows: 


1 0  Mother  Sea 

Chiefly  at  night,  but  occasionally  in  broad  daylight,  a  shoal  of 
small  squids  shot  out  of  the  water  precisely  like  flying  fish,  gliding 
through  the  air  as  much  as  up  to  six  feet  above  the  surface,  until 
they  lost  the  speed  accumulated  below  water,  and  fell  down  help¬ 
lessly.  In  their  gliding  flight  with  flaps  out  they  were  so  much  like 
small  flying  fish  at  a  distance,  that  we  had  no  idea  we  saw  anything 
unusual  until  a  live  squid  flew  right  into  one  of  the  crew  and  fell 
down  on  deck.  Almost  every  night  we  found  one  or  two  on  the 
deck  or  on  the  roof  of  the  bamboo  hut. 

It  was  my  own  definite  impression  that  the  marine  life  in  gen¬ 
eral  went  deeper  down  in  the  daytime  than  during  the  nights,  and 
that  the  darker  the  night  was,  the  more  life  we  had  around  us. 
At  two  different  occasions,  a  snake-mackerel,  Cempylus,  never  be¬ 
fore  seen  by  man  except  as  skeletal  remains  washed  ashore  on 
South  America  and  the  Galapagos,  came  jumping  clear  out  of  the 
water  and  right  up  on  the  raft  (once  right  into  the  hut) .  To  judge 
from  the  huge  eyes  and  the  fact  that  the  fish  has  never  before 
been  observed,  I  am  inclined  to  suspect  that  it  is  a  deep-sea  fish 
that  comes  to  the  surface  only  at  night. 

On  dark  nights  we  could  see  much  marine  life  which  we  were 
unable  to  identify.  They  seemed  to  be  deep-sea  fishes  approaching 
the  surface  at  night.  Generally  we  saw  it  as  vaguely  phosphores¬ 
cent  bodies,  often  the  size  and  shape  of  a  dinner  plate,  but  at  least 
one  night  in  the  shape  of  three  immense  bodies  of  irregular  and 
changing  shape  and  dimensions  which  appeared  to  exceed  those 
of  the  raft  (Kon-tiki  measured  about  45  by  18  feet).  Apart  from 
these  greater  bodies,  we  observed  occasionally  great  quantities  of 
phosphorescent  plankton,  often  containing  illuminating  copepods 
up  to  the  size  of  a  millimeter  or  more. 

With  these  surface  waters,  through  a  series  of  delicately  ad¬ 
justed,  interlocking  relationships,  the  life  of  all  parts  of  the  sea 
is  linked.  What  happens  to  a  diatom  in  the  upper,  sunlit  strata 
of  the  sea  may  well  determine  what  happens  to  a  cod  lying  on  a 
ledge  of  some  rocky  canyon  a  hundred  fathoms  below,  or  to  a 
bed  of  multicolored,  gorgeously  plumed  seaworms  carpeting  an 
underlying  shoal,  or  to  a  prawn  creeping  over  the  soft  oozes  of 
the  sea  floor  in  the  blackness  of  mile-deep  water. 

The  activities  of  the  microscopic  vegetables  of  the  sea,  of 
which  the  diatoms  are  most  important,  make  the  mineral  wealth 


The  Pattern  of  the  Surface

of  the  water  available  to  the  animals.  Feeding  directly  on  the 
diatoms  and  other  groups  of  minute  unicellular  algae  are  the 
marine  protozoa,  many  crustaceans,  the  young  of  crabs,  bar¬ 
nacles,  sea  worms,  and  fishes.  Hordes  of  the  small  carnivores,  the 
first  link  in  the  chain  of  flesh  eaters,  move  among  these  peaceful 
grazers.  There  are  fierce  little  dragons  half  an  inch  long,  the 
sharp-jawed  arrowworms.  There  are  gooseberrylike  comb  jellies, 
armed  with  grasping  tentacles,  and  there  are  the  shrimplike 
euphausiids  that  strain  food  from  the  water  with  their  bristly 
appendages.  Since  they  drift  where  the  currents  carry  them,  with 
no  power  or  will  to  oppose  that  of  the  sea,  this  strange  commu¬ 
nity  of  creatures  and  the  marine  plants  that  sustain  them  are 
called  'plankton,’  a  word  derived  from  the  Greek,  meaning 
'wandering.’ 

From  the  plankton  the  food  chains  lead  on,  to  the  schools  of 
plankton-feeding  fishes  like  the  herring,  menhaden,  and  mack¬ 
erel;  to  the  fish-eating  fishes  like  the  bluefish  and  tuna  and 
sharks;  to  the  pelagic  squids  that  prey  on  fishes;  to  the  great 
whales  who,  according  to  their  species  but  not  according  to  their 
size,  may  live  on  fishes,  on  shrimps,  or  on  some  of  the  smallest 
of  the  plankton  creatures. 

Unmarked  and  trackless  though  it  may  seem  to  us,  the  surface 
of  the  ocean  is  divided  into  definite  zones,  and  the  pattern  of  the 
surface  water  controls  the  distribution  of  its  life.  Fishes  and 
plankton,  whales  and  squids,  birds  and  sea  turtles,  all  are  linked 
by  unbreakable  ties  to  certain  kinds  of  water— to  warm  water  or 
cold  water,  to  clear  or  turbid  water,  to  water  rich  in  phosphates 
or  in  silicates.  For  the  animals  higher  in  the  food  chains  the  ties 
are  less  direct;  they  are  bound  to  water  where  their  food  is  plen¬ 
tiful,  and  the  food  animals  are  there  because  the  water  condi¬ 
tions  are  right. 

The  change  from  zone  to  zone  may  be  abrupt.  It  may  come 
upon  us  unseen,  as  our  ship  at  night  crosses  an  invisible  bound¬ 
ary  line.  So  Charles  Darwin  on  H.M.S.  Beagle  one  dark  night  off 
the  coast  of  South  America  crossed  from  tropical  water  into  that 
of  the  cool  south.  Instantly  the  vessel  was  surrounded  by  numer¬ 
ous  seals  and  penguins,  which  made  such  a  bedlam  of  strange 


20 


Mother  Sea 


noises  that  the  officer  on  watch  was  deceived  into  thinking  the 
ship  had,  by  some  miscalculation,  run  close  inshore,  and  that  the 
sounds  he  heard  were  the  bellowing  of  cattle. 

To  the  human  senses,  the  most  obvious  patterning  of  the  sur¬ 
face  waters  is  indicated  by  color.  The  deep  blue  water  of  the 
open  sea  far  from  land  is  the  color  of  emptiness  and  barrenness; 
the  green  water  of  the  coastal  areas,  with  all  its  varying  hues,  is 
the  color  of  life.  The  sea  is  blue  because  the  sunlight  is  reflected 
back  to  our  eyes  from  the  water  molecules  or  from  very  minute 
particles  suspended  in  the  sea.  In  the  journey  of  the  light  rays 
into  deep  water  all  the  red  rays  and  most  of  the  yellow  rays  of 
the  spectrum  have  been  absorbed,  so  when  the  light  returns  to 
our  eyes  it  is  chiefly  the  cool  blue  rays  that  we  see.  Where  the 
water  is  rich  in  plankton,  it  loses  the  glassy  transparency  that 
permits  this  deep  penetration  of  the  light  rays.  The  yellow  and 
brown  and  green  hues  of  the  coastal  waters  are  derived  from  the 
minute  algae  and  other  microorganisms  so  abundant  there. 
Seasonal  abundance  of  certain  forms  containing  reddish  or 
brown  pigments  may  cause  the  'red  water'  known  from  ancient 
times  in  many  parts  of  the  world,  and  so  common  in  this  con¬ 
dition  in  some  enclosed  seas  that  they  owe  their  names  to  it — 
the  Red  Sea  and  the  Vermilion  Sea  are  examples. 

The  colors  of  the  sea  are  only  the  indirect  signs  of  the  pres¬ 
ence  or  absence  of  conditions  needed  to  support  the  surface  life; 
other  zones,  invisible  to  the  eye,  are  the  ones  that  largely  deter¬ 
mine  where  marine  creatures  may  live.  For  the  sea  is  by  no 
means  a  uniform  solution  of  water;  parts  of  it  are  more  salty  than 
others,  and  parts  are  warmer  or  colder. 

The  saltiest  ocean  water  in  the  world  is  that  of  the  Red  Sea, 
where  the  burning  sun  and  the  fierce  heat  of  the  atmosphere 
produce  such  rapid  evaporation  that  the  salt  content  is  40  parts 
per  thousand.  The  Sargasso  Sea,  an  area  of  high  air  temperatures, 
receiving  no  inflow  of  river  water  or  melting  ice  because  of  its 
remoteness  from  land,  is  the  saltiest  part  of  the  Atlantic,  which 
in  turn  is  the  saltiest  of  the  oceans.  The  polar  seas,  as  one  would 
expect,  are  the  least  salty,  because  they  are  constantly  being 
diluted  by  rain,  snow,  and  melting  ice.  Along  the  Atlantic  coast 


The  Pattern  of  the  Surface 


21 


of  the  United  States,  the  salinity  range  from  about  33  parts  per 
thousand  off  Cape  Cod  to  about  36  off  Florida  is  a  difference 
easily  perceptible  to  the  senses  of  human  bathers. 

Ocean  temperatures  vary  from  about  28°  F.  in  polar  seas  to 
96°  in  the  Persian  Gulf,  which  contains  the  hottest  ocean  water 
in  the  world.  To  creatures  of  the  sea,  which  with  few  exceptions 
must  match  in  their  own  bodies  the  temperature  of  the  sur¬ 
rounding  water,  this  range  is  tremendous,  and  change  of  tem¬ 
perature  is  probably  the  most  important  single  condition  that 
controls  the  distribution  of  marine  animals. 

The  beautiful  reef  corals  are  a  perfect  example  of  the  way  the 
inhabitable  areas  for  any  particular  class  of  creatures  may  be 
established  by  temperatures.  If  you  took  a  map  of  the  world  and 
drew  a  line  30°  north  of  the  equator  and  another  30°  south  of 
it,  you  would  have  outlined  in  general  the  waters  where  reef 
corals  are  found  at  the  present  time.  It  is  true  that  the  remains 
of  ancient  coral  reefs  have  been  discovered  in  arctic  waters,  but 
this  means  that  in  some  past  ages  the  climate  of  these  northern 
seas  was  tropical.  The  calcareous  structure  of  the  coral  reef  can 
be  fashioned  only  in  water  at  least  as  warm  as  70°  Fahrenheit. 
We  would  have  to  make  one  northward  extension  of  our  map, 
where  the  Gulf  Stream  carries  water  warm  enough  for  corals  to 
Bermuda,  at  320  north  latitude.  On  the  other  hand,  within  our 
tropical  belt,  we  would  have  to  erase  large  areas  on  the  west 
coasts  of  South  America  and  Africa,  where  upwelling  of  cold 
water  from  lower  ocean  levels  prevents  the  growth  of  corals. 
Most  of  the  east  coast  of  Florida  has  no  coral  reefs  because  of 
a  cool  inshore  current,  running  southward  between  the  coast  and 
the  Gulf  Stream. 

As  between  tropical  and  polar  regions,  the  differences  in  the 
kinds  and  abundance  of  life  are  tremendous.  The  warm  tem¬ 
peratures  of  the  tropics  speed  up  the  processes  of  reproduction 
and  growth,  so  that  many  generations  are  produced  in  the  time 
required  to  bring  one  to  maturity  in  cold  seas.  There  is  more 
opportunity  for  genetic  mutations  to  be  produced  within  a  given 
time;  hence  the  bewildering  variety  of  tropical  life.  Yet  in  any 
species  there  are  far  fewer  individuals  than  in  the  colder  zones, 


22 


Mother  Sea 


where  the  mineral  content  of  the  water  is  richer,  and  there  are 
no  dense  swarms  of  surface  plankton,  like  the  copepods  of  the 
Arctic.  The  pelagic,  or  free-swimming,  forms  of  the  tropics  live 
deeper  than  those  of  the  colder  regions,  and  so  there  is  less  food 
for  large  surface-feeders.  In  the  tropics,  therefore,  the  sea  birds 
do  not  compare  in  abundance  with  the  clouds  of  shearwaters, 
fulmars,  auks,  whalebirds,  albatrosses,  and  other  birds  seen  over 
far  northern  or  far  southern  fishing  grounds. 

In  the  cold-water  communities  of  the  polar  seas,  fewer  of  the 
animals  have  swimming  larvae.  Generation  after  generation  set¬ 
tle  down  near  the  parents,  so  that  large  areas  of  bottom  may  be 
covered  with  the  descendants  of  a  very  few  animals.  In  the 
Barents  Sea  a  research  vessel  once  brought  up  more  than  a  ton 
of  one  of  the  siliceous  sponges  at  a  single  haul,  and  enormous 
patches  of  a  single  species  of  annelid  worm  carpet  the  east  coast 
of  Spitsbergen.  Copepods  and  swimming  snails  fill  the  surface 
waters  of  the  cold  seas,  and  lure  the  herring  and  the  mackerel, 
the  flocks  of  sea  birds,  the  whales,  and  the  seals. 

In  the  tropics,  then,  sea  life  is  intense,  vivid,  and  infinitely 
varied.  In  cold  seas  it  proceeds  at  a  pace  slowed  by  the  icy  water 
in  which  it  exists,  but  the  mineral  richness  of  these  waters 
(largely  a  result  of  seasonal  overturn  and  consequent  mixing) 
makes  possible  the  enormous  abundance  of  the  forms  that  in¬ 
habit  them.  For  a  good  many  years  it  has  been  said  categorically 
that  the  total  productivity  of  the  colder  temperate  and  polar 
seas  is  far  greater  than  the  tropical.  Now  it  is  becoming  plain 
that  there  are  important  exceptions  to  this  statement.  In  certain 
tropical  and  subtropical  waters,  there  are  areas  where  the  sheer 
abundance  of  life  rivals  the  Grand  Banks  or  the  Barents  Sea  or 
any  antarctic  whaling  ground.  Perhaps  the  best  examples  are 
the  Humboldt  Current,  off  the  west  coast  of  South  America, 
and  the  Benguela  Current,  off  the  west  coast  of  Africa.  In  both 
currents,  upwelling  of  cold,  mineral-laden  water  from  deeper 
layers  of  the  sea  provides  the  fertilizing  elements  to  sustain  the 
great  food  chains. 

And  wherever  two  currents  meet,  especially  if  they  differ 
sharply  in  temperature  or  salinity,  there  are  zones  of  great  tur- 


The  Pattern  of  the  Surface

bulence  and  unrest,  with  water  sinking  or  rising  up  from  the 
depths  and  with  shifting  eddies  and  foam  lines  at  the  surface. 
At  such  places  the  richness  and  abundance  of  marine  life  reveals 
itself  most  strikingly.  This  changing  life,  seen  as  his  ship  cut 
across  the  pathways  of  the  great  currents  of  the  Pacific  and  the 
Atlantic,  was  described  with  vivid  detail  by  S.  C.  Brooks: 

Within  a  few  degrees  of  the  equator,  the  scattered  cumulus 
clouds  become  thicker  and  grayer,  a  confused  swell  makes  up, 
rain  squalls  come  and  go,  and  birds  appear.  At  first  there  is  only 
a  greater  abundance  of  storm  petrels,  with  here  and  there  petrels 
of  other  kinds  hunting  along  utterly  indifferent  to  the  ship,  or 
small  groups  of  tropic  birds  flying  along  with  the  ship,  off  to  one 
side  or  high  overhead.  Then  scattered  groups  of  various  petrels 
appear,  and  finally  for  an  hour  or  two  there  are  birds  on  every 
hand.  If  one  is  not  too  far  from  land,  a  few  hundred  miles  per¬ 
haps,  as  in  the  case  of  the  south  equatorial  drift  north  of  the 
Marquesas,  one  may  also  see  multitudes  of  sooty  or  crested  terns. 
Occasionally  one  sees  the  grayish  blue  form  of  a  shark  gliding 
along,  or  a  big  purplish-brown  hammerhead  lazily  twisting  around 
as  though  trying  to  get  a  better  view  of  the  ship.  Flying  fish, 
while  not  so  closely  localized  as  the  birds,  are  breaking  the  water 
every  few  seconds,  and  bewitch  the  beholder  by  their  myriad 
sizes,  shapes,  and  antics,  and  their  bewildering  patterns  and 
shades  of  deep  brown,  opal  blue,  yellow  and  purple.  Then  the 
sun  comes  out  again,  the  sea  takes  on  its  deep  tropical  blue,  the 
birds  become  more  and  more  scarce,  and  gradually,  as  the  ship 
moves  on,  the  ocean  resumes  its  desert  aspect. 

If  it  were  daylight  all  the  time,  this  same  sequence  might  be 
seen  in  a  more  or  less  striking  fashion  twice  or  perhaps  even  three 
or  four  times.  Inquiry  soon  reveals  that  this  sequence  marks  the 
time  of  passing  the  edge  of  one  of  the  great  currents  .  .  . 

In  the  North  Atlantic  ship  lanes  the  same  play  is  staged  with 
different  actors.  Instead  of  the  equatorial  currents  there  are  the 
Gulf  Stream  and  its  continuation,  the  North  Atlantic  Drift,  and 
the  Arctic  Current;  instead  of  confused  swell  and  squalls  of  rain 
there  are  slicks  and  fogs.  Tropic-birds  are  replaced  by  jaegers  and 
skuas;  and  different  species  of  the  petrel  group,  usually  here 
spoken  of  as  shearwaters  and  fulmars,  are  flying  or  swimming 
about,  often  in  great  flocks  .  .  .  Here,  too,  perhaps,  one  sees  less 


Mother  Sea 


24 

of  sharks  and  more  of  porpoise  racing  with  the  cut-water  or  dog¬ 
gedly  hurrying,  school  after  school,  toward  some  unguessable 
objective.  The  flashing  black  and  white  of  the  young  orcas,  or  the 
distant  sudden  spurt  and  lazy  drift  of  a  whale's  spouting,  lend 
life  to  the  water,  as  do  the  antics  of  flying  fish,  distant  though 
they  be  from  their  traditional  home  in  the  tropics  .  .  .  One  may 
pass  from  the  blue  water  of  the  Stream,  with  floating  gulf  weed 
(Sargassum),  and  perhaps  here  and  there  the  iridescent  float  of 
a  Portuguese  man-of-war,  into  the  gray-green  water  of  the  Arctic 
Current  with  its  thousands  of  jelly  fish,  and  in  a  few  hours  back 
again  into  the  Stream.  Each  time,  at  the  margin,  one  is  likely 
to  see  the  surface  display  of  that  abundance  of  life  which  has 
made  the  Grand  Banks  one  of  the  great  fisheries  of  the  world.* 

The  mid-ocean  regions,  bounded  by  the  currents  that  sweep 
around  the  ocean  basins,  are  in  general  the  deserts  of  the  sea. 
There  are  few  birds  and  few  surface-feeding  fishes,  and  indeed 
there  is  little  surface  plankton  to  attract  them.  The  life  of  these 
regions  is  largely  confined  to  deep  water.  The  Sargasso  Sea  is  an 
exception,  not  matched  in  the  anticyclonic  centers  of  other 
ocean  basins.  It  is  so  different  from  any  other  place  on  earth  that 
it  may  well  be  considered  a  definite  geographic  region.  A  line 
drawn  from  the  mouth  of  Chesapeake  Bay  to  Gibraltar  would 
skirt  its  northern  border;  another  from  Haiti  to  Dakar  would 
mark  its  southern  boundary.  It  lies  all  about  Bermuda  and  ex¬ 
tends  more  than  halfway  across  the  Atlantic,  its  entire  area  being 
roughly  as  large  as  the  United  States.  The  Sargasso,  with  all  its 
legendary  terrors  for  sailing  ships,  is  a  creation  of  the  great  cur¬ 
rents  of  the  North  Atlantic  that  encircle  it  and  bring  into  it  the 
millions  of  tons  of  floating  sargassum  weed  from  which  the  place 
derives  its  name,  and  all  the  weird  assemblage  of  animals  that 
live  in  the  weed. 

The  Sargasso  is  a  place  forgotten  by  the  winds,  undisturbed  by 
the  strong  flow  of  waters  that  girdle  it  as  with  a  river.  Under  the 
seldom-clouded  skies,  its  waters  are  warm  and  heavy  with  salt. 
Separated  widely  from  coastal  rivers  and  from  polar  ice,  there  is 
no  inflow  of  fresh  water  to  dilute  its  saltiness;  the  only  influx

is  of  saline  water  from  the  adjacent  currents,  especially  from  the 
Gulf  Stream  or  North  Atlantic  Current  as  it  crosses  from  Amer¬ 
ica  to  Europe.  And  with  the  little,  inflowing  streams  of  surface 
water  come  the  plants  and  animals  that  for  months  or  years  have, 
drifted  in  the  Gulf  Stream. 

The  sargassum  weeds  are  brown  algae  belonging  to  several 
species.  Quantities  of  the  weeds  live  attached  to  reefs  or  rocky 
outcroppings  off  the  coasts  of  the  West  Indies  and  Florida. 
Many  of  the  plants  are  torn  away  by  storms,  especially  during; 
the  hurricane  season.  They  are  picked  up  by  the  Gulf  Stream 
and  are  drifted  northward.  With  the  weeds  go,  as  involuntary 
passengers,  many  small  fishes,  crabs,  shrimps,  and  innumerable 
larvae  of  assorted  species  of  marine  creatures,  whose  home  had 
been  the  coastal  banks  of  sargassum  weed. 

Curious  things  happen  to  the  animals  that  have  ridden  on  the 
sargassum  weed  into  a  new  home.  Once  they  lived  near  the  sea’s 
edge,  a  few  feet  or  a  few  fathoms  below  the  surface,  but  never 
far  above  a  firm  bottom.  They  knew  the  rhythmic  movements 
of  waves  and  tides.  They  could  leave  the  shelter  of  the  weeds  at 
will  and  creep  or  swim  about  over  the  bottom  in  search  of  food. 
Now,  in  the  middle  of  the  ocean,  they  are  in  a  new  world.  The 
bottom  lies  two  or  three  miles  below  them.  Those  who  are  poor 
swimmers  must  cling  to  the  weed,  which  now  represents  a  life 
raft,  supporting  them  above  the  abyss.  Over  the  ages  since  their 
ancestors  came  here,  some  species  have  developed  special  organs 
of  attachment,  either  for  themselves  or  for  their  eggs,  so  that 
they  may  not  sink  into  the  cold,  dark  water  far  below.  The  flying 
fish  make  nests  of  the  weed  to  contain  their  eggs,  which  bear  an 
amazing  resemblance  to  the  sargassum  floats  or  Terries.’ 

Indeed,  many  of  the  little  marine  beasts  of  the  weedy  jungle 
seem  to  be  playing  an  elaborate  game  of  disguise  in  which  each 
is  camouflaged  to  hide  it  from  the  others.  The  Sargasso  sea  slug 
—a  snail  without  a  shell— has  a  soft,  shapeless  brown  body  spot¬ 
ted  with  dark-edged  circles  and  fringed  with  flaps  and  folds  of 
skin,  so  that  as  it  creeps  over  the  weed  in  search  of  prey  it  can 
scarcely  be  distinguished  from  the  vegetation.  One  of  the  fiercest 
carnivores  of  the  place,  the  sargassum  fish  Pterophryne,  has 


i6 


Mother  Sea 

copied  with  utmost  fidelity  the  branching  fronds  of  the  weed, 
its  golden  berries,  its  rich  brown  color,  and  even  the  white  dots 
of  encrusting  worm  tubes.  All  these  elaborate  bits  of  mimicry  are 
indications  of  the  fierce  internecine  wars  of  the  Sargasso  jungles, 

which  go  on  without  quarter  and  without  mercy  for  the  weak  or 
the  unwary. 

In  the  science  of  the  sea  there  has  been  a  long-standing  con¬ 
troversy  about  the  origin  of  the  drifting  weeds  of  the  Sargasso 
Sea.  Some  have  held  that  the  supply  is  maintained  by  weeds  re¬ 
cently  torn  away  from  coastal  beds;  others  say  that  the  rather 
limited  sargassum  fields  of  the  West  Indies  and  Florida  cannot 
possibly  supply  the  immense  area  of  the  Sargasso.  They  believe 
that  we  find  here  a  self-perpetuating  community  of  plants  that 
have  become  adapted  to  life  in  the  open  sea,  needing  no  roots 
or  holdfasts  for  attachment,  and  able  to  propagate  vegetatively. 
Probably  there  is  truth  in  both  ideas.  New  plants  do  come  in 
each  year  in  small  numbers,  and  now  cover  an  immense  area  be¬ 
cause  of  their  very  long  life  once  they  have  reached  this  quiet 
central  region  of  the  Atlantic. 

It  takes  about  half  a  year  for  the  plants  torn  from  West  Indian 
shores  to  reach  the  northern  border  of  the  Sargasso,  perhaps 
several  years  for  them  to  be  carried  into  the  inner  parts  of  this 
area.  Meanwhile,  some  have  been  swept  onto  the  shores  of 
North  America  by  storms,  others  have  been  killed  by  cold  during 
the  passage  from  offshore  New  England  across  the  Atlantic, 
where  the  Gulf  Stream  comes  into  contact  with  waters  from  the 
Arctic.  For  the  plants  that  reach  the  calm  of  the  Sargasso,  there 
is  virtual  immortality.  A.  E.  Parr  of  the  American  Museum  has 
recently  suggested  that  the  individual  plants  may  live,  some  for 
decades,  other  for  centuries,  according  to  their  species.  It  might 
well  be  that  some  of  the  very  weeds  you  would  see  if  you  visited 
the  place  today  were  seen  by  Columbus  and  his  men.  Here,  in 
the  heait  of  the  Atlantic,  the  weed  drifts  endlessly,  growing,  re¬ 
producing  vegetatively  by  a  process  of  fragmentation.  Appar¬ 
ently  almost  the  only  plants  that  die  are  the  ones  that  drift  into 
unfavorable  conditions  around  the  edges  of  the  Sargasso  or  are 
picked  up  by  outward-moving  currents. 


The  Pattern  of  the  Surface 


27 


Such  losses  are  balanced,  or  possibly  a  little  more  than  bal¬ 
anced,  by  the  annual  addition  of  weeds  from  distant  coasts.  It 
must  have  taken  eons  of  time  to  accumulate  the  present  enor¬ 
mous  quantities  of  weed,  which  Parr  estimates  as  about  10  mil¬ 
lion  tons.  But  this,  of  course,  is  distributed  over  so  large  an  area 
that  most  of  the  Sargasso  is  open  water.  The  dense  fields  of 
weeds  waiting  to  entrap  a  vessel  never  existed  except  in  the 
imaginations  of  sailors,  and  the  gloomy  hulks  of  vessels  doomed 
to  endless  drifting  in  the  clinging  weed  are  only  the  ghosts  of 
things  that  never  were. 


The  Changing  Year 


THUS  WITH  THE  YEAR  SEASONS  RETURN. 

— Milton 


Jl  OR  the  sea  as  a  whole,  the  alternation  of  day  and  night,  the 
passage  of  the  seasons,  the  procession  of  the  years,  are  lost  in  its 
vastness,  obliterated  in  its  own  changeless  eternity.  But  the  sur¬ 
face  waters  are  different.  The  face  of  the  sea  is  always  changing. 
Crossed  by  colors,  lights,  and  moving  shadows,  sparkling  in  the 
sun,  mysterious  in  the  twilight,  its  aspects  and  its  moods  vary 
hour  by  hour.  The  surface  waters  move  with  the  tides,  stir  to  the 
breath  of  the  winds,  and  rise  and  fall  to  the  endless,  hurrying 
forms  of  the  waves.  Most  of  all,  they  change  with  the  advance  of 
the  seasons.  Spring  moves  over  the  temperate  lands  of  our  North¬ 
ern  Hemisphere  in  a  tide  of  new  life,  of  pushing  green  shoots 
and  unfolding  buds,  all  its  mysteries  and  meanings  symbolized  in 
the  northward  migration  of  the  birds,  the  awakening  of  sluggish 
amphibian  life  as  the  chorus  of  frogs  rises  again  from  the  wet 
lands,  the  different  sound  of  the  wind  which  stirs  the  young 
leaves  where  a  month  ago  it  rattled  the  bare  branches.  These 
things  we  associate  with  the  land,  and  it  is  easy  to  suppose  that 
at  sea  there  could  be  no  such  feeling  of  advancing  spring.  But 


The  Changing  Year  29 

the  signs  are  there,  and  seen  with  understanding  eye,  they  bring 

the  same  magical  sense  of  awakening. 

In  the  sea,  as  on  land,  spring  is  a  time  for  the  renewal  of  life. 
During  the  long  months  of  winter  in  the  temperate  zones  the 
surface  waters  have  been  absorbing  the  cold.  Now  the  heavy 
water  begins  to  sink,  slipping  down  and  displacing  the  warmer 
layers  below.  Rich  stores  of  minerals  have  been  accumulating  on 
the  floor  of  the  continental  shelf— some  freighted  down  the 
rivers  from  the  lands;  some  derived  from  sea  creatures  that  have 
died  and  whose  remains  have  drifted  down  to  the  bottom,  some 
from  the  shells  that  once  encased  a  diatom,  the  streaming  proto¬ 
plasm  of  a  radiolarian,  or  the  transparent  tissues  of  a  pteropod. 
Nothing  is  wasted  in  the  sea;  every  particle  of  material  is  used 
over  and  over  again,  first  by  one  creature,  then  by  another.  And 
when  in  spring  the  waters  are  deeply  stirred,  the  warm  bottom 
water  brings  to  the  surface  a  rich  supply  of  minerals,  ready  for 
use  by  new  forms  of  life. 

Just  as  land  plants  depend  on  minerals  in  the  soil  for  their 
growth,  every  marine  plant,  even  the  smallest,  is  dependent  upon 
the  nutrient  salts  or  minerals  in  the  sea  water.  Diatoms  must 
have  silica,  the  element  of  which  their  fragile  shells  are  rash- 
ioned.  For  these  and  all  other  microplants,  phosphorus  is  an 
indispensable  mineral.  Some  of  these  elements  are  in  short  sup¬ 
ply  and  in  winter  may  be  reduced  below  the  minimum  necessary 
for  growth.  The  diatom  population  must  tide  itself  over  this 
season  as  best  it  can.  It  faces  a  stark  problem  of  survival,  with  no 
opportunity  to  increase,  a  problem  of  keeping  alive  the  spark  of 
life  by  forming  tough  protective  spores  against  the  stringency 
of  winter,  a  matter  of  existing  in  a  dormant  state  in  which  no 
demands  shall  be  made  on  an  environment  that  already  with¬ 
holds  all  but  the  most  meager  necessities  of  life.  So  the  diatoms 
hold  their  place  in  the  winter  sea,  like  seeds  of  wheat  in  a  field 
under  snow  and  ice,  the  seeds  from  which  the  spring  grow th  w  ill 

come.  . 

These,  then,  are  the  elements  of  the  vernal  blooming  of  the 
sea:  the  ‘seeds’  of  the  dormant  plants,  the  fertilizing  chemicals, 
the  warmth  of  the  spring  sun.

Mother  Sea 


In  a  sudden  awakening,  incredible  in  its  swiftness,  the  simplest 
plants  of  the  sea  begin  to  multiply.  Their  increase  is  of  astro¬ 
nomical  proportions.  The  spring  sea  belongs  at  first  to  the  dia¬ 
toms  and  to  all  the  other  microscopic  plant  life  of  the  plankton. 
In  the  fierce  intensity  of  their  growth  they  cover  vast  areas  of 
ocean  with  a  living  blanket  of  their  cells.  Mile  after  mile  of  water 
may  appear  red  or  brown  or  green,  the  whole  surface  taking  on 
the  color  of  the  infinitesimal  grains  of  pigment  contained  in  each 
of  the  plant  cells. 

The  plants  have  undisputed  sway  in  the  sea  for  only  a  short 
time.  Almost  at  once  their  own  burst  of  multiplication  is 
matched  by  a  similar  increase  in  the  small  animals  of  the  plank¬ 
ton.  It  is  the  spawning  time  of  the  copepod  and  the  glassworm, 
the  pelagic  shrimp  and  the  winged  snail.  Hungry  swarms  of  these 
little  beasts  of  the  plankton  roam  through  the  waters,  feeding  on 
the  abundant  plants  and  themselves  falling  prey  to  larger  crea¬ 
tures.  Now  in  the  spring  the  surface  waters  become  a  vast 
nursery.  From  the  hills  and  valleys  of  the  continent’s  edge  lying 
far  below,  and  from  the  scattered  shoals  and  banks,  the  eggs  or 
young  of  many  of  the  bottom  animals  rise  to  the  surface  of  the 
sea.  Even  those  which,  in  their  maturity,  will  sink  down  to  a 
sedentary  life  on  the  bottom,  spend  the  first  weeks  of  life  as 
freely  swimming  hunters  of  the  plankton.  So  as  spring  progresses 
new  batches  of  larvae  rise  into  the  surface  each  day,  the  young 
of  fishes  and  crabs  and  mussels  and  tube  worms,  mingling  for  a 
time  with  the  regular  members  of  the  plankton. 

Under  the  steady  and  voracious  grazing,  the  grasslands  of  the 
surface  are  soon  depleted.  The  diatoms  become  more  and  more 
scarce,  and  with  them  the  other  simple  plants.  Still  there  are 
brief  explosions  of  one  or  another  form,  when  in  a  sudden  orgy 
of  cell  division  it  comes  to  claim  whole  areas  of  the  sea  for  its 
own.  So,  for  a  time  each  spring,  the  waters  may  become  blotched 
with  brown,  jellylike  masses,  and  the  fishermen’s  nets  come  up 
dripping  a  brown  slime  and  containing  no  fish,  for  the  herring 
have  turned  away  from  these  waters  as  though  in  loathing  of  the 
viscid,  foul-smelling  algae.  But  in  less  time  than  passes  between

the  full  moon  and  the  new,  the  spring  flowering  of  Phaeocystis 
is  past  and  the  waters  have  cleared  again. 

In  the  spring  the  sea  is  filled  with  migrating  fishes,  some  of 
them  bound  for  the  mouths  of  great  rivers,  which  they  will  as¬ 
cend  to  deposit  their  spawn.  Such  are  the  spring-run  chinooks 
coming  in  from  the  deep  Pacific  feeding  grounds  to  breast  the 
rolling  flood  of  the  Columbia,  the  shad  moving  in  to  the  Chesa¬ 
peake  and  the  Hudson  and  the  Connecticut,  the  alewives  seek¬ 
ing  a  hundred  coastal  streams  of  New  England,  the  salmon 
feeling  their  way  to  the  Penobscot  and  the  Kennebec.  For 
months  or  years  these  fish  have  known  only  the  vast  spaces  of 
the  ocean.  Now  the  spring  sea  and  the  maturing  of  their  own 
bodies  lead  them  back  to  the  rivers  of  their  birth. 

Other  mysterious  comings  and  goings  are  linked  with  the  ad¬ 
vance  of  the  year.  Capelin  gather  in  the  deep,  cold  water  of  the 
Barents  Sea,  their  shoals  followed  and  preyed  upon  by  flocks  of 
auks,  fulmars,  and  kittiwakes.  Cod  approach  the  banks  of  Lofo¬ 
ten,  and  gather  off  the  shores  of  Iceland.  Birds  whose  winter 
feeding  territory  may  have  encompassed  the  whole  Atlantic  or 
the  whole  Pacific  converge  upon  some  small  island,  the  entire 
breeding  population  arriving  within  the  space  of  a  few  days. 
Whales  suddenly  appear  off  the  slopes  of  the  coastal  banks 
where  the  swarms  of  shrimplike  krill  are  spawning,  the  whales 
having  come  from  no  one  knows  where,  by  no  one  knows  what 
route. 

With  the  subsiding  of  the  diatoms  and  the  completed  spawn¬ 
ing  of  many  of  the  plankton  animals  and  most  of  the  fish,  life 
in  the  surface  waters  slackens  to  the  slower  pace  of  midsummer. 
Along  the  meeting  places  of  the  currents  the  pale  moon  jelly 
Aurelia  gathers  in  thousands,  forming  sinuous  lines  or  windrows 
across  miles  of  sea,  and  the  birds  see  their  pale  forms  shimmering 
deep  down  in  the  green  water.  By  midsummer  the  large  red 
jellyfish  Cyanea  may  have  grown  from  the  size  of  a  thimble  to 
that  of  an  umbrella.  The  great  jellyfish  moves  through  the  sea 
with  rhythmic  pulsations,  trailing  long  tentacles  and  as  likely  as 
not  shepherding  a  little  group  of  young  cod  or  haddock,  which 
find  shelter  under  its  bell  and  travel  with  it.

A  hard,  brilliant,  coruscating  phosphorescence  often  illumi¬ 
nates  the  summer  sea.  In  waters  where  the  protozoa  Noctiluca  is 
abundant  it  is  the  chief  source  of  this  summer  luminescence, 
causing  fishes,  squids,  or  dolphins  to  fill  the  water  with  racing 
flames  and  to  clothe  themselves  in  a  ghostly  radiance.  Or  again 
the  summer  sea  may  glitter  with  a  thousand  thousand  moving 
pinpricks  of  light,  like  an  immense  swarm  of  fireflies  moving 
through  a  dark  wood.  Such  an  effect  is  produced  by  a  shoal  of 
the  brilliantly  phosphorescent  shrimp  Meganyctiphanes,  a  crea¬ 
ture  of  cold  and  darkness  and  of  the  places  where  icy  water  rolls 
upward  from  the  depths  and  bubbles  with  white  ripplings  at  the 
surface. 

Out  over  the  plankton  meadows  of  the  North  Atlantic  the  dry 
twitter  of  the  phalaropes,  small  brown  birds,  wheeling  and  turn- 
ing,  dipping  and  rising,  is  heard  for  the  first  time  since  early 
spring.  The  phalaropes  have  nested  on  the  arctic  tundras,  reared 
their  young,  and  now  the  first  of  them  are  returning  to  the  sea. 
Most  of  them  will  continue  south  over  the  open  water  far  from 
land,  crossing  the  equator  into  the  South  Atlantic.  Here  they  will 
follow  where  the  great  whales  lead,  for  where  the  whales  are, 
there  also  are  the  swarms  of  plankton  on  which  these  strange 
little  birds  grow  fat. 

As  the  fall  advances,  there  are  other  movements,  some  in  the 
surface,  some  hidden  in  the  green  depths,  that  betoken  the  end 
of  summer.  In  the  fog-covered  waters  of  Bering  Sea,  down 
through  the  treacherous  passes  between  the  islands  of  the  Aleu¬ 
tian  chain  and  southward  into  the  open  Pacific,  the  herds  of  fur 
seals  are  moving.  Left  behind  are  two  small  islands,  treeless  bits 
of  volcanic  soil  thrust  up  into  the  waters  of  Bering  Sea.  The 
islands  are  silent  now,  but  for  the  several  months  of  summer 
they  resounded  with  the  roar  of  millions  of  seals  come  ashore  to 
bear  and  rear  their  young— all  the  fur  seals  of  the  eastern  Pacific 
crowded  into  a  few  square  miles  of  bare  rock  and  crumbling  soil. 
Now  once  more  the  seals  turn  south,  to  roam  down  along  the 
sheer  underwater  cliffs  of  the  continent’s  edge,  where  the  rocky 
foundations  fall  away  steeply  into  the  deep  sea.  Here,  in  a  black¬ 
ness  more  absolute  than  that  of  arctic  winter,  the  seals  will  find

rich  feeding  as  they  swim  down  to  prey  on  the  fishes  of  this 
region  of  darkness. 

Autumn  comes  to  the  sea  with  a  fresh  blaze  of  phosphores¬ 
cence,  when  every  wave  crest  is  aflame.  Here  and  there  the 
whole  surface  may  glow  with  sheets  of  cold  fire,  while  below 
schools  of  fish  pour  through  the  water  like  molten  metal.  Often 
the  autumnal  phosphorescence  is  caused  by  a  fall  flowering  of 
the  dinoflagellates,  multiplying  furiously  in  a  short-lived  repeti¬ 
tion  of  their  vernal  blooming. 

Sometimes  the  meaning  of  the  glowing  water  is  ominous.  Off 
the  Pacific  coast  of  North  America,  it  may  mean  that  the  sea  is 
filled  with  the  dinoflagellate  Gonyaulax,  a  minute  plant  that 
contains  a  poison  of  strange  and  terrible  virulence.  About  four 
days  after  Gonyaulax  comes  to  dominate  the  coastal  plankton, 
some  of  the  fishes  and  shellfish  in  the  vicinity  become  toxic.  This 
is  because,  in  their  normal  feeding,  they  have  strained  the  poison¬ 
ous  plankton  out  of  the  water.  Mussels  accumulate  the  Gony¬ 
aulax  toxins  in  their  livers,  and  the  toxins  react  on  the  human 
nervous  system  with  an  effect  similar  to  that  of  strychnine. 
Because  of  these  facts,  it  is  generally  understood  along  the  Pa¬ 
cific  coast  that  it  is  unwise  to  eat  shellfish  taken  from  coasts 
exposed  to  the  open  sea  where  Gonyaulax  may  be  abundant,  in 
summer  or  early  fall.  For  generations  before  the  white  men 
came,  the  Indians  knew  this.  As  soon  as  the  red  streaks  appeared 
in  the  sea  and  the  waves  began  to  flicker  at  night  with  the 
mysterious  blue-green  fires,  the  tribal  leaders  forbade  the  taking 
of  mussels  until  these  warning  signals  should  have  passed.  They 
even  set  guards  at  intervals  along  the  beaches  to  warn  inlanders 
who  might  come  down  for  shellfish  and  be  unable  to  read  the 
language  of  the  sea. 

But  usually  the  blaze  and  glitter  of  the  sea,  whatever  its  mean¬ 
ing  for  those  who  produce  it,  implies  no  menace  to  man.  Seen 
from  the  deck  of  a  vessel  in  open  ocean,  a  tiny,  man-made  ob¬ 
servation  point  in  the  vast  world  of  sea  and  sky,  it  has  an  eerie 
and  unearthly  quality.  Man,  in  his  vanity,  subconsciously  at¬ 
tributes  a  human  origin  to  any  light  not  of  moon  or  stars  or  sun. 
Lights  on  the  shore,  lights  moving  over  the  water,  mean  lights

kindled  and  controlled  by  other  men,  serving  purposes  under¬ 
standable  to  the  human  mind.  Yet  here  are  lights  that  flash  and 
fade  away,  lights  that  come  and  go  for  reasons  meaningless  to 
man,  lights  that  have  been  doing  this  very  thing  over  the  eons 
of  time  in  which  there  were  no  men  to  stir  in  vague  disquiet. 

On  such  a  night  of  phosphorescent  display  Charles  Darwin 
stood  on  the  deck  of  the  Beagle  as  she  plowed  southward 
through  the  Atlantic  off  the  coast  of  Brazil. 

The  sea  from  its  extreme  luminousness  presented  a  wonderful 
and  most  beautiful  appearance  [he  wrote  in  his  diary].  Every 
part  of  the  water  which  by  day  is  seen  as  foam,  glowed  with  a 
pale  light.  The  vessel  drove  before  her  bows  two  billows  of 
liquid  phosphorus,  and  in  her  wake  was  a  milky  train.  As  far  as 
the  eye  reached  the  crest  of  every  wave  was  bright;  and  from  the 
reflected  light,  the  sky  just  above  the  horizon  was  not  so  utterly 
dark  as  the  rest  of  the  Heavens.  It  was  impossible  to  behold  this 
plain  of  matter,  as  it  were  melted  and  consuming  by  heat,  without 

being  reminded  of  Milton’s  description  of  the  regions  of  Chaos 
and  Anarchy.* 

Like  the  blazing  colors  of  the  autumn  leaves  before  they 
wither  and  fall,  the  autumnal  phosphorescence  betokens  the 
approach  of  winter.  After  their  brief  renewal  of  life  the  flagel¬ 
lates  and  the  other  minute  algae  dwindle  away  to  a  scattered 
few;  so  do  the  shrimps  and  the  copepods,  the  glassworms  and 
the  comb  jellies.  The  larvae  of  the  bottom  fauna  have  long  since 
completed  their  development  and  drifted  away  to  take  up  what¬ 
ever  existence  is  their  lot.  Even  the  roving  fish  schools  have 
deserted  the  surface  waters  and  have  migrated  into  warmer  lati¬ 
tudes  or  have  found  equivalent  warmth  in  the  deep,  quiet  waters 
along  the  edge  of  the  continental  shelf.  There  the  torpor  of 
semi-hibernation  descends  upon  them  and  will  possess  them 
during  the  months  of  winter. 

The  surface  waters  now  become  the  plaything  of  the  winter 
gales.  As  the  winds  build  up  the  giant  storm  waves  and  roar

along  their  crests,  lashing  the  water  into  foam  and  flying  spray, 
it  seems  that  life  must  forever  have  deserted  this  place. 

For  the  mood  of  the  winter  sea,  read  Joseph  Conrad’s  descrip¬ 
tion: 


The  greyness  of  the  whole  immense  surface,  the  wind  furrows 
upon  the  faces  of  the  waves,  the  great  masses  of  foam,  tossed 
about  and  waving,  like  matted  white  locks,  give  to  the  sea  in  a 
gale  an  appearance  of  hoary  age,  lustreless,  dull,  without  gleams, 
as  though  it  had  been  created  before  light  itself.* 

But  the  symbols  of  hope  are  not  lacking  even  in  the  grayness 
and  bleakness  of  the  winter  sea.  On  land  we  know  that  the  ap¬ 
parent  lifelessness  of  winter  is  an  illusion.  Look  closely  at  the 
bare  branches  of  a  tree,  on  which  not  the  palest  gleam  of  green 
can  be  discerned.  Yet,  spaced  along  each  branch  are  the  leaf 
buds,  all  the  spring’s  magic  of  swelling  green  concealed  and 
safely  preserved  under  the  insulating,  overlapping  layers.  Pick  off 
a  piece  of  the  rough  bark  of  the  trunk;  there  you  will  find  hiber¬ 
nating  insects.  Dig  down  through  the  snow  into  the  earth.  There 
are  the  eggs  of  next  summer’s  grasshoppers;  there  are  the  dor¬ 
mant  seeds  from  which  will  come  the  grass,  the  herb,  the  oak 
tree. 

So,  too,  the  lifelessness,  the  hopelessness,  the  despair  of  the 
winter  sea  are  an  illusion.  Everywhere  are  the  assurances  that 
the  cycle  has  come  to  the  full,  containing  the  means  of  its  own 
renewal.  There  is  the  promise  of  a  new  spring  in  the  very  iciness 
of  the  winter  sea,  in  the  chilling  of  the  water,  which  must,  before 
many  weeks,  become  so  heavy  that  it  will  plunge  downward, 
precipitating  the  overturn  that  is  the  first  act  in  the  drama  of 
spring.  There  is  the  promise  of  new  life  in  the  small  plantlike 
things  that  cling  to  the  rocks  of  the  underlying  bottom,  the  al¬ 
most  formless  polyps  from  which,  in  spring,  a  new  generation  of 
jellyfish  will  bud  off  and  rise  into  the  surface  waters.  There  is 
unconscious  purpose  in  the  sluggish  forms  of  the  copepods  hiber¬ 
nating  on  the  bottom,  safe  from  the  surface  storms,  life  sustained

m  their  tmy  bodies  by  the  extra  store  of  fat  with  which  thev 
went  into  this  winter  sleep. 

Already,  from  the  gray  shapes  of  cod  that  have  moved,  unseen 
by  man,  through  the  cold  sea  to  their  spawning  places,  the  glassy 
globules  of  eggs  are  rising  into  the  surface  waters.  Even  in  the 
harsh  world  of  the  winter  sea,  these  eggs  will  begin  the  swift 

divisions  by  which  a  granule  of  protoplasm  becomes  a  living 
fishlet.  6 

Most  of  all,  perhaps,  there  is  assurance  in  the  fine  dust  of  life 
that  remains  in  the  surface  waters,  the  invisible  spores  of  the 
diatoms,  needing  only  the  touch  of  warming  sun  and  fertilizing 
chemicals  to  repeat  the  magic  of  spring. 


The  Sunless  Sea 


WHERE  GREAT  WHALES  COME  SAILING  BY, 
SAIL  AND  SAIL,  WITH  UNSHUT  EYE. 

— Matthew  Arnold 


.  L^ETWEEN  the  sunlit  surface  waters  of  the  open  sea  and 
the  hidden  hills  and  valleys  of  the  ocean  floor  lies  the  least- 
known  region  of  the  sea.  These  deep,  dark  waters,  with  all  their 
mysteries  and  their  unsolved  problems,  cover  a  very  considerable 
part  of  the  earth.  The  whole  world  ocean  extends  over  about 
three-fourths  of  the  surface  of  the  globe.  If  we  subtract  the 
shallow  areas  of  the  continental  shelves  and  the  scattered  banks 
and  shoals,  where  at  least  the  pale  ghost  of  sunlight  moves  over 
the  underlying  bottom,  there  still  remains  about  half  the  earth 
that  is  covered  by  miles-deep,  lightless  water,  that  has  been  dark 
since  the  world  began. 

This  region  has  withheld  its  secrets  more  obstinately  than  any 
other.  Man,  with  all  his  ingenuity,  has  been  able  to  venture  only 
to  its  threshold.  Wearing  a  diving  helmet,  he  can  walk  on  the 
ocean  floor  about  10  fathoms  down.  He  can  descend  to  an  ex¬ 
treme  limit  of  about  500  feet  in  a  complete  diving  suit,  so  heavily 
armored  that  movement  is  almost  impossible,  carrying  with  him 
a  constant  supply  of  oxygen.  Only  two  men  in  all  the  history  of 


3^  Mother  Sea 

the  world  have  had  the  experience  of  descending,  alive,  beyond 
the  range  of  visible  light.  These  men  are  William  Beebe  and 
Otis  Barton.  In  the  bathysphere,  they  reached  a  depth  of  3028 
feet  in  the  open  ocean  off  Bermuda,  in  the  year  1934.  Barton 
alone,  in  a  steel  sphere  known  as  the  benthoscope,  descended  to 

the  great  depth  of  4500  feet  off  California,  in  the  summer  of 
1949.2 

Although  only  a  fortunate  few  can  ever  visit  the  deep  sea,  the 
precise  instruments  of  the  oceanographer,  recording  light  pene¬ 
tration,  pressure,  salinity,  and  temperature,  have  given  us  the 
materials  with  which  to  reconstruct  in  imagination  these  eerie, 
forbidding  regions.  Unlike  the  surface  waters,  which  are  sensitive 
to  every  gust  of  wind,  which  know  day  and  night,  respond  to  the 
pull  of  sun  and  moon,  and  change  as  the  seasons  change,  the 
deep  waters  are  a  place  where  change  comes  slowly,  if  at  all. 
Down  beyond  the  reach  of  the  sun's  rays,  there  is  no  alternation 
of  light  and  darkness.  There  is  rather  an  endless  night,  as  old  as 
the  sea  itself.  For  most  of  its  creatures,  groping  their  way  end¬ 
lessly  through  its  black  waters,  it  must  be  a  place  of  hunger, 
where  food  is  scarce  and  hard  to  find,  a  shelterless  place  where 
there  is  no  sanctuary  from  ever-present  enemies,  where  one  can 
only  move  on  and  on,  from  birth  to  death,  through  the  darkness, 
confined  as  in  a  prison  to  his  own  particular  layer  of  the  sea. 

They  used  to  say  that  nothing  could  live  in  the  deep  sea.  It 
was  a  belief  that  must  have  been  easy  to  accept,  for  without 
proof  to  the  contrary,  how  could  anyone  conceive  of  life  in  such 
a  place? 

A  century  ago  the  British  biologist  Edward  Forbes  wrote:  'As 
we  descend  deeper  and  deeper  into  this  region,  the  inhabitants 
become  more  and  more  modified,  and  fewer  and  fewer,  indicat¬ 
ing  our  approach  to  an  abyss  where  life  is  either  extinguished,  or 
exhibits  but  a  few  sparks  to  mark  its  lingering  presence.'  Yet 
Forbes  urged  further  exploration  of  'this  vast  deep-sea  region'  to 
settle  forever  the  question  of  the  existence  of  life  at  great  depths. 

Even  then,  the  evidence  was  accumulating.  Sir  John  Ross, 
during  his  exploration  of  the  arctic  seas  in  1818,  had  brought  up 
from  a  depth  of  1000  fathoms  mud  in  which  there  were  worms,

'thus  proving  there  was  animal  life  in  the  bed  of  the  ocean  not¬ 
withstanding  the  darkness,  stillness,  silence,  and  immense  pres¬ 
sure  produced  by  more  than  a  mile  of  superincumbent  water/ 

Then  from  the  surveying  ship  Bulldog ,  examining  a  proposed 
northern  route  for  a  cable  from  Faroe  to  Labrador  in  i860,  came 
another  report.  The  Bulldog’s  sounding  line,  which  at  one  place 
had  been  allowed  to  lie  for  some  time  on  the  bottom  at  a  depth 
of  1260  fathoms,  came  up  with  13  starfish  clinging  to  it.  Through 
these  starfish,  the  ship's  naturalist  wrote,  'the  deep  has  sent  forth 
the  long  coveted  message.'  But  not  all  the  zoologists  of  the  day 
were  prepared  to  accept  the  message.  Some  doubters  asserted 
that  the  starfish  had  'convulsively  embraced’  the  line  somewhere 
on  the  way  back  to  the  surface. 

In  the  same  year,  i860,  a  cable  in  the  Mediterranean  was 
raised  for  repairs  from  a  depth  of  1200  fathoms.  It  was  found  to 
be  heavily  encrusted  with  corals  and  other  sessile  animals  that 
had  attached  themselves  at  an  early  stage  of  development  and 
grown  to  maturity  over  a  period  of  months  or  years.  There  was 
not  the  slightest  chance  that  they  had  become  entangled  in  the 
cable  as  it  was  being  raised  to  the  surface. 

Then  the  Challenger ,  the  first  ship  ever  equipped  for  ocean¬ 
ographic  exploration,  set  out  from  England  in  the  year  1872  and 
traced  a  course  around  the  globe.  From  bottoms  lying  under 
miles  of  water,  from  silent  deeps  carpeted  with  red  clay  ooze, 
and  from  all  the  lightless  intermediate  depths,  net-haul  after  net- 
haul  of  strange  and  fantastic  creatures  came  up  and  were  spilled 
out  on  the  decks.  Poring  over  the  weird  beings  thus  brought  up 
for  the  first  time  into  the  light  of  day,  beings  no  man  had  ever 
seen  before,  the  Challenger  scientists  realized  that  life  existed 
even  on  the  deepest  floor  of  the  abyss. 

1  he  recent  discovery  that  a  living  cloud  of  some  unknown 
creatures  is  spread  over  much  of  the  ocean  at  a  depth  of  several 
hundred  fathoms  below  the  surface  is  the  most  exciting  thing 
that  has  been  learned  about  the  ocean  for  many  years. 

When,  during  the  first  quarter  of  the  twentieth  century,  echo 
sounding  was  developed  to  allow  ships  while  under  way  to  record 
the  depth  of  the  bottom,  probably  no  one  suspected  that  it 


4° 


Mother  Sea 


would  also  provide  a  means  of  learning  something  about  deep- 
sea  life.  But  operators  of  the  new  instruments  soon  discovered 
that  the  sound  waves,  directed  downward  from  the  ship  like  a 
beam  of  light,  were  reflected  back  from  any  solid  object  they 
met.  Answering  echoes  were  returned  from  intermediate  depths, 
presumably  from  schools  of  fish,  whales,  or  submarines;  then  a 
second  echo  was  received  from  the  bottom. 

These  facts  were  so  well  established  by  the  late  1930's  that  fish¬ 
ermen  had  begun  to  talk  about  using  their  fathometers  to  search 
for  schools  of  herring.  Then  the  war  brought  the  whole  subject 
under  strict  security  regulations,  and  little  more  was  heard  about 
it.  In  1946,  however,  the  United  States  Navy  issued  a  significant 
bulletin.  It  was  reported  that  several  scientists,  working  with 
sonic  equipment  in  deep  water  off  the  California  coast,  had  dis¬ 
covered  a  widespread  flayer'  of  some  sort,  which  gave  back  an 
answering  echo  to  the  sound  waves.  This  reflecting  layer,  seem¬ 
ingly  suspended  between  the  surface  and  the  floor  of  the  Pacific, 
was  found  over  an  area  300  miles  wide.  It  lay  from  1000  to  1500 
feet  below  the  surface.  The  discovery  was  made  by  three  scien¬ 
tists,  C.  F.  Eyring,  R.  }.  Christensen,  and  R.  W.  Raitt,  aboard 
the  U.S.S.  Jasper  in  1942,  and  for  a  time  this  mysterious  phe¬ 
nomenon,  of  wholly  unknown  nature,  was  called  the  ECR  layer. 
Then  in  1943  Martin  W.  Johnson,  marine  biologist  of  the 
Scripps  Institution  of  Oceanography,  made  a  further  discovery 
which  gave  the  first  clue  to  the  nature  of  the  layer.  Working 
aboard  the  vessel  E.  W.  Scripps ,  Johnson  found  that  whatever 
sent  back  the  echoes  moved  upward  and  downward  in  rhythmic 
fashion,  being  found  near  the  surface  at  night,  in  deep  water 
during  the  day.  This  discovery  disposed  of  speculations  that  the 
reflections  came  from  something  inanimate,  perhaps  a  mere 
physical  discontinuity  in  the  water,  and  showed  that  the  layer 
is  composed  of  living  creatures  capable  of  controlled  movement. 

From  this  time  on,  discoveries  about  the  sea's  'phantom  bot¬ 
tom'  came  rapidly.  With  widespread  use  of  echo-sounding  in¬ 
struments,  it  has  become  clear  that  the  phenomenon  is  not  some- 
thing  peculiar  to  the  coast  of  California  alone.  It  occurs  almost 
universally  in  the  deep  ocean  basins — drifting  by  day  at  a  depth

of  several  hundred  fathoms,  at  night  rising  to  the  surface,  and 
again,  before  sunrise,  sinking  into  the  depths. 

On  the  passage  of  the  U.S.S.  Henderson  from  San  Diego  to 
the  Antarctic  in  1947,  reflecting  layer  was  detected  during 
the  greater  part  of  each  day,  at  depths  varying  from  150  to  450 
fathoms,  and  on  a  later  run  from  San  Diego  to  Yokosuka,  Japan, 
the  Henderson  s  fathometer  again  recorded  the  layer  every  day, 
suggesting  that  it  exists  almost  continuously  across  the  Pacific. 

During  July  and  August  1947,  the  U.S.S.  Nereus  made  a  con¬ 
tinuous  fathogram  from  Pearl  Harbor  to  the  Arctic  and  found 
the  scattering  layer  over  all  deep  waters  along  this  course.  It 
did  not  develop,  however,  in  the  shallow  Bering  and  Chuckchee 
seas.  Sometimes  in  the  morning,  the  Nereus  fathogram  showed 
two  layers,  responding  in  different  ways  to  the  growing  illumina¬ 
tion  of  the  water;  both  descended  into  deep  water,  but  there  was 
an  interval  of  twenty  minutes  between  the  two  descents. 

Despite  attempts  to  sample  it  or  photograph  it,  no  one  is  sure 
what  the  layer  is,  although  the  discovery  may  be  made  any  day. 
There  are  three  principal  theories,  each  of  which  has  its  group 
of  supporters.  According  to  these  theories,  the  sea's  phantom  bot¬ 
tom  may  consist  of  small  planktonic  shrimps,  of  fishes,  or  of 
squids. 

As  for  the  plankton  theory,  one  of  the  most  convincing  argu¬ 
ments  is  the  well-known  fact  that  many  plankton  creatures  make 
regular  vertical  migrations  of  hundreds  of  feet,  rising  toward  the 
surface  at  night,  sinking  down  below  the  zone  of  light  penetra¬ 
tion  very  early  in  the  morning.  This  is,  of  course,  exactly  the  be¬ 
havior  of  the  scattering  layer.  Whatever  composes  it  is  appar¬ 
ently  strongly  repelled  by  sunlight.  The  creatures  of  the  layer 
seem  almost  to  be  held  prisoner  at  the  end— or  beyond  the  end 
— of  the  sun's  rays  throughout  the  hours  of  daylight,  waiting  only 
for  the  welcome  return  of  darkness  to  hurry  upward  into  the 
surface  waters.  But  what  is  the  power  that  repels;  and  what  the 
attraction  that  draws  them  surfaceward  once  the  inhibiting  force 
is  removed?  Is  it  comparative  safety  from  enemies  that  makes 
them  seek  darkness?  Is  it  more  abundant  food  near  the  surface 
that  lures  them  back  under  cover  of  night?

Mother  Sea 


Those  who  say  that  fish  are  the  reflectors  of  the  sound  waves 
usually  account  for  the  vertical  migrations  of  the  layer  by  sug¬ 
gesting  that  the  fish  are  feeding  on  planktonic  shrimp  and  are 
following  their  food.  They  believe  that  the  air  bladder  of  a  fish 
is,  of  all  structures  concerned,  most  likely  from  its  construction 
to  return  a  strong  echo.  There  is  one  outstanding  difficulty  in 
the  way  of  accepting  this  theory:  we  have  no  other  evidence  that 
concentrations  of  fish  are  universally  present  in  the  oceans.  In 
fact,  almost  everything  else  we  know  suggests  that  the  really 
dense  populations  of  fish  live  over  the  continental  shelves  or  in 
certain  very  definitely  determined  zones  of  the  open  ocean  where 
food  is  particularly  abundant.  If  the  reflecting  layer  is  eventu¬ 
ally  proved  to  be  composed  of  fish,  the  prevailing  views  of  fish 
distribution  will  have  to  be  radically  revised. 

The  most  startling  theory  (and  the  one  that  seems  to  have  the 
fewest  supporters)  is  that  the  layer  consists  of  concentrations  of 
squid,  ‘hovering  below  the  illuminated  zone  of  the  sea  and  await¬ 
ing  the  arrival  of  darkness  in  which  to  resume  their  raids  into 
the  plankton-rich  surface  waters/  Proponents  of  this  theory 
argue  that  squid  are  abundant  enough,  and  of  wide  enough  dis¬ 
tribution,  to  give  the  echoes  that  have  been  picked  up  almost 
everywhere  from  the  equator  to  the  two  poles.  Squid  are  known 
to  be  the  sole  food  of  the  sperm  whale,  found  in  the  open  oceans 
in  all  temperate  and  tropical  waters.  They  also  form  the  exclu¬ 
sive  diet  of  the  bottlenosed  whale  and  are  eaten  extensively  by 
most  other  toothed  whales,  by  seals,  and  by  many  sea  birds.  All 
these  facts  argue  that  they  must  be  prodigiously  abundant. 

It  is  true  that  men  who  have  worked  close  to  the  sea  surface 
at  night  have  received  vivid  impressions  of  the  abundance  and 
activity  of  squids  in  the  surface  waters  in  darkness.  Long  ago 
Johan  Hjort  wrote: 

One  night  we  were  hauling  long  lines  on  the  Faroe  slope, 
working  with  an  electric  lamp  hanging  over  the  side  in  order  to 
see  the  line,  when  like  lightning  flashes  one  squid  after  another 
shot  towards  the  light ...  In  October  1902  we  were  one  night 
steaming  outside  the  slopes  of  the  coast  banks  of  Norway,  and 
for  many  miles  we  could  see  the  squids  moving  in  the  surface 


The  Sunless  Sea

waters  like  luminous  bubbles,  resembling  large  milky  white  electric 

lamps  being  constantly  lit  and  extinguished.* 

Thor  Heyerdahl  reports  that  at  night  his  raft  was  literally 
bombarded  by  squids;  and  Richard  Fleming  says  that  in  his 
oceanographic  work  off  the  coast  of  Panama  it  was  common  to 
see  immense  schools  of  squid  gathering  at  the  surface  at  night 
and  leaping  upward  toward  the  lights  that  were  used  by  the 
men  to  operate  their  instruments.  But  equally  spectacular  sur¬ 
face  displays  of  shrimp  have  been  seen,  and  most  people  find 
it  difficult  to  believe  in  the  ocean-wide  abundance  of  squid. 

Deep-water  photography  holds  much  promise  for  the  solution 
of  the  mystery  of  the  phantom  bottom.  There  are  technical  diffi¬ 
culties,  such  as  the  problem  of  holding  a  camera  still  as  it  swings 
at  the  end  of  a  long  cable,  twisting  and  turning,  suspended  from 
a  ship  which  itself  moves  with  the  sea.  Some  of  the  pictures  so 
taken  look  as  though  the  photographer  has  pointed  his  camera 
at  a  starry  sky  and  swung  it  in  an  arc  as  he  exposed  the  film. 
Yet  the  Norwegian  biologist  Gunnar  Rollefson  had  an  encour¬ 
aging  experience  in  correlating  photography  with  echograms.  On 
the  research  ship  Johan  Hjort  off  the  Lofoten  Islands,  he  per¬ 
sistently  got  reflection  of  sound  from  schools  of  fish  in  20  to  30 
fathoms.  A  specially  constructed  camera  was  lowered  to  the 
depth  indicated  by  the  echogram.  When  developed,  the  film 
showed  moving  shapes  of  fish  at  a  distance,  and  a  large  and 
clearly  recognizable  cod  appeared  in  the  beam  of  light  and  hov¬ 
ered  in  front  of  the  lens. 

Direct  sampling  of  the  layer  is  the  logical  means  of  discovering 
its  identity,  but  the  problem  is  to  develop  large  nets  that  can  be 
operated  rapidly  enough  to  capture  swift-moving  animals.  Sci¬ 
entists  at  Woods  Hole,  Massachusetts,  have  towed  ordinary 
plankton  nets  in  the  layer  and  have  found  that  euphausiid 
shrimps,  glassworms,  and  other  deep-water  plankton  are  concen¬ 
trated  there;  but  there  is  still  a  possibility  that  the  layer  itself 
may  actually  be  made  up  of  larger  forms  feeding  on  the  shrimps

— too  large  or  swift  to  be  taken  in  the  presently  used  nets.  New 
nets  may  give  the  answer.  Television  is  another  possibility.3 

Shadowy  and  indefinite  though  they  be,  these  recent  indica¬ 
tions  of  an  abundant  life  at  mid-depths  agree  with  the  reports  of 
the  only  observers  who  have  actually  visited  comparable  depths 
and  brought  back  eyewitness  accounts  of  what  they  saw.  William 
Beebe's  impressions  from  the  bathysphere  were  of  a  life  far  more 
abundant  and  varied  than  he  had  been  prepared  to  find, 
although,  over  a  period  of  six  years,  he  had  made  many  hundreds 
of  net-hauls  in  the  same  area.  More  than  a  quarter  of  a  mile 
down,  he  reported  aggregations  of  living  things  'as  thick  as  I  have 
ever  seen  them.'  At  half  a  mile— the  deepest  descent  of  the  bathy¬ 
sphere — Dr.  Beebe  recalled  that  'there  was  no  instant  when  a 
mist  of  plankton  .  .  .  was  not  swirling  in  the  path  of  the  beam.' 

The  existence  of  an  abundant  deep-sea  fauna  was  discovered, 
probably  millions  of  years  ago,  by  certain  whales  and  also,  it 
now  appears,  by  seals.  The  ancestors  of  all  whales,  we  know  by 
fossil  remains,  were  land  mammals.  They  must  have  been  preda¬ 
tory  beasts,  if  we  are  to  judge  by  their  powerful  jaws  and  teeth. 
Perhaps  in  their  foragings  about  the  deltas  of  great  rivers  or 
around  the  edges  of  shallow  seas,  they  discovered  the  abundance 
of  fish  and  other  marine  life  and  over  the  centuries  formed  the 
habit  of  following  them  farther  and  farther  into  the  sea.  Little 
by  little  their  bodies  took  on  a  form  more  suitable  for  aquatic 
life;  their  hind  limbs  were  reduced  to  rudiments,  which  may  be 
discovered  in  a  modern  whale  by  dissection,  and  the  forelimbs 
were  modified  into  organs  for  steering  and  balancing. 

Eventually  the  whales,  as  though  to  divide  the  sea's  food 
resources  among  them,  became  separated  into  three  groups:  the 
plankton-eaters,  the  fish-eaters,  and  the  squid-eaters.  The  plank¬ 
ton-eating  whales  can  exist  only  where  there  are  dense  masses 
of  small  shrimp  or  copepods  to  supply  their  enormous  food  re¬ 
quirements.  This  limits  them,  except  for  scattered  areas,  to  arctic 
and  antarctic  waters  and  the  high  temperate  latitudes.  Fish-eat¬ 
ing  whales  may  find  food  over  a  somewhat  wider  range  of  ocean, 
but  they  are  restricted  to  places  where  there  are  enormous  pop¬ 
ulations  of  schooling  fish.  The  blue  water  of  the  tropics  and  of 


The  Sunless  Sea

the  open  ocean  basins  offers  little  to  either  of  these  groups.  But 
that  immense,  square-headed,  formidably  toothed  whale  known 
as  the  cachalot  or  sperm  whale  discovered  long  ago  what  men 
have  known  for  only  a  short  time— that  hundreds  of  fathoms  be¬ 
low  the  almost  untenanted  surface  waters  of  these  regions  there 
is  an  abundant  animal  life.  The  sperm  whale  has  taken  these 
deep  waters  for  his  hunting  grounds;  his  quarry  is  the  deep¬ 
water  population  of  squids,  including  the  giant  squid  Architeu- 
this,  which  lives  pelagically  at  depths  of  1 500  feet  or  more.  The 
head  of  the  sperm  whale  is  often  marked  with  long  stripes,  which 
consist  of  a  great  number  of  circular  scars  made  by  the  suckers 
of  the  squid.  From  this  evidence  we  can  imagine  the  battles  that 
go  on,  in  the  darkness  of  the  deep  water,  between  these  two 
huge  creatures— the  sperm  whale  with  its  70-ton  bulk,  the  squid 
with  a  body  as  long  as  30  feet,  and  writhing,  grasping  arms  ex¬ 
tending  the  total  length  of  the  animal  to  perhaps  50  feet. 

The  greatest  depth  at  which  the  giant  squid  lives  is  not  defi¬ 
nitely  known,  but  there  is  one  instructive  piece  of  evidence  about 
the  depth  to  which  sperm  whales  descend,  presumably  in  search 
of  the  squids.  In  April  1932,  the  cable  repair  ship  All  America 
was  investigating  an  apparent  break  in  the  submarine  cable  be¬ 
tween  Balboa  in  the  Canal  Zone  and  Esmeraldas,  Ecuador.  The 
cable  was  brought  to  the  surface  off  the  coast  of  Colombia.  En¬ 
tangled  in  it  was  a  dead  45-foot  male  sperm  whale.  The  sub¬ 
marine  cable  was  twisted  around  the  lower  jaw  and  was  wrapped 
around  one  flipper,  the  body,  and  the  caudal  flukes.  The  cable 
was  raised  from  a  depth  of  540  fathoms,  or  3240  feet.4 

Some  of  the  seals  also  appear  to  have  discovered  the  hidden 
food  reserves  of  the  deep  ocean.  It  has  long  been  something  of 
a  mystery  where,  and  on  what,  the  northern  fur  seals  of  the  east¬ 
ern  Pacific  feed  during  the  winter,  which  they  spend  off  the  coast 
of  North  America  from  California  to  Alaska.  There  is  no  evi¬ 
dence  that  they  are  feeding  to  any  great  extent  on  sardines, 
mackerel,  or  other  commercially  important  fishes.  Presumably 
four  million  seals  could  not  compete  with  commercial  fishermen 
for  the  same  species  without  the  fact  being  known.  But  there  is 
some  evidence  on  the  diet  of  the  fur  seals,  and  it  is  highly  signifi-

cant.  Their  stomachs  have  yielded  the  bones  of  a  species  of  fish 
that  has  never  been  seen  alive.  Indeed,  not  even  its  remains  have 
been  found  anywhere  except  in  the  stomachs  of  seals.  Ichthyol¬ 
ogists  say  that  this  'seal  fish’  belongs  to  a  group  that  typically 
inhabits  very  deep  water,  off  the  edge  of  the  continental  shelf. 

How  either  whales  or  seals  endure  the  tremendous  pressure 
changes  involved  in  dives  of  several  hundred  fathoms  is  not 
definitely  known.  They  are  warm-blooded  mammals  like  our¬ 
selves.  Caisson  disease,  which  is  caused  by  the  rapid  accumula¬ 
tion  of  nitrogen  bubbles  in  the  blood  with  sudden  release  of 
pressure,  kills  human  divers  if  they  are  brought  up  rapidly  from 
depths  of  200  feet  or  so.  Yet,  according  to  the  testimony  of  whal¬ 
ers,  a  baleen  whale,  when  harpooned,  can  dive  straight  down 
to  a  depth  of  half  a  mile,  as  measured  by  the  amount  of  line  car¬ 
ried  out.  From  these  depths,  where  it  has  sustained  a  pressure 
of  half  a  ton  on  every  inch  of  body,  it  returns  almost  imme¬ 
diately  to  the  surface.  The  most  plausible  explanation  is  that, 
unlike  the  diver,  who  has  air  pumped  to  him  while  he  is  under 
water,  the  whale  has  in  its  body  only  the  limited  supply  it  carries 
down,  and  does  not  have  enough  nitrogen  in  its  blood  to  do 
serious  harm.  The  plain  truth  is,  however,  that  we  really  do  not 
know,  since  it  is  obviously  impossible  to  confine  a  living  whale 
and  experiment  on  it,  and  almost  as  difficult  to  dissect  a  dead  one 
satisfactorily. 

At  first  thought  it  seems  a  paradox  that  creatures  of  such  great 
fragility  as  the  glass  sponge  and  the  jellyfish  can  live  under  the 
conditions  of  immense  pressure  that  prevail  in  deep  water.  For 
creatures  at  home  in  the  deep  sea,  however,  the  saving  fact  is 
that  the  pressure  inside  their  tissues  is  the  same  as  that  without, 
and,  as  long  as  this  balance  is  preserved,  they  are  no  more  incon¬ 
venienced  by  a  pressure  of  a  ton  or  so  than  we  are  by  ordinary 
atmospheric  pressure.  And  most  abyssal  creatures,  it  must  be 
remembered,  live  out  their  whole  lives  in  a  comparatively  re¬ 
stricted  zone,  and  are  never  required  to  adjust  themselves  to 
extreme  changes  of  pressure. 

But  of  course  there  are  exceptions,  and  the  real  miracle  of  sea 
life  in  relation  to  great  pressure  is  not  the  animal  that  lives  its 


The  Sunless  Sea 


47 


whole  life  on  the  bottom,  bearing  a  pressure  of  perhaps  five  or 
six  tons,  but  those  that  regularly  move  up  and  down  through 
hundreds  or  thousands  of  feet  of  vertical  change.  The  small 
shrimps  and  other  planktonic  creatures  that  descend  into  deep 
water  during  the  day  are  examples.  Fish  that  possess  air  bladders, 
on  the  other  hand,  are  vitally  affected  by  abrupt  changes  of  pres¬ 
sure,  as  anyone  knows  who  has  seen  a  trawler’s  net  raised  from 
a  hundred  fathoms.  Apart  from  the  accident  of  being  captured 
in  a  net  and  hauled  up  through  waters  of  rapidly  diminishing 
pressures,  fish  may  sometimes  wander  out  of  the  zone  to  which 
they  are  adjusted  and  find  themselves  unable  to  return.  Perhaps 
in  their  pursuit  of  food  they  roam  upward  to  the  ceiling  of  the 
zone  that  is  theirs,  and  beyond  whose  invisible  boundary  they 
may  not  stray  without  meeting  alien  and  inhospitable  conditions. 
Moving  from  layer  to  layer  of  drifting  plankton  as  they  feed, 
they  may  pass  beyond  the  boundary.  In  the  lessened  pressure  of 
these  upper  waters  the  gas  enclosed  within  the  air  bladder  ex¬ 
pands.  The  fish  becomes  lighter  and  more  buoyant.  Perhaps  he 
tries  to  fight  his  way  down  again,  opposing  the  upward  lift  with 
all  the  power  of  his  muscles.  If  he  does  not  succeed,  he  ‘falls’ 
to  the  surface,  injured  and  dying,  for  the  abrupt  release  of  pres¬ 
sure  from  without  causes  distension  and  rupture  of  the  tissues. 

The  compression  of  the  sea  under  its  own  weight  is  relatively 
slight,  and  there  is  no  basis  for  the  old  and  picturesque  belief 
that,  at  the  deeper  levels,  the  water  resists  the  downward  passage 
of  objects  from  the  surface.  According  to  this  belief,  sinking 
ships,  the  bodies  of  drowned  men,  and  presumably  the  bodies  of 
the  larger  sea  animals  not  consumed  above  by  hungry  scavengers, 
never  reach  the  bottom,  but  come  to  rest  at  some  level  deter¬ 
mined  by  the  relation  of  their  own  weight  to  the  compression 
of  the  water,  there  to  drift  forever.  The  fact  is  that  anything 
will  continue  to  sink  as  long  as  its  specific  gravity  is  greater  than 
that  of  the  surrounding  water,  and  all  large  bodies  descend,  in  a 
matter  of  a  few  days,  to  the  ocean  floor.  As  mute  testimony  to 
this  fact,  we  bring  up  from  the  deepest  ocean  basins  the  teeth  of 
sharks  and  the  hard  ear  bones  of  whales. 

Nevertheless  the  weight  of  sea  water — the  pressing  down  ol 


Mother  Sea 


48 

miles  of  water  upon  all  the  underlying  layers— does  have  a  certain 
effect  upon  the  water  itself.  If  this  downward  compression  could 
suddenly  be  relaxed  by  some  miraculous  suspension  of  natural 
laws,  the  sea  level  would  rise  about  93  feet  all  over  the  world. 
This  would  shift  the  Atlantic  coastline  of  the  United  States 
westward  a  hundred  miles  or  more  and  alter  other  familiar  geo¬ 
graphic  outlines  all  over  the  world. 

Immense  pressure,  then,  is  one  of  the  governing  conditions  of 
life  in  the  deep  sea;  darkness  is  another.  The  unrelieved  darkness 
of  the  deep  waters  has  produced  weird  and  incredible  modifica¬ 
tions  of  the  abyssal  fauna.  It  is  a  blackness  so  divorced  from  the 
world  of  the  sunlight  that  probably  only  the  few  men  who  have 
seen  it  with  their  own  eyes  can  visualize  it.  We  know  that  light 
fades  out  rapidly  with  descent  below  the  surface.  The  red  rays 
are  gone  at  the  end  of  the  first  200  or  300  feet,  and  with  them 
all  the  orange  and  yellow  warmth  of  the  sun.  Then  the  greens 
fade  out,  and  at  1000  feet  only  a  deep,  dark,  brilliant  blue  is  left. 
In  very  clear  waters  the  violet  rays  of  the  spectrum  may  pene¬ 
trate  another  thousand  feet.  Beyond  this  is  only  the  blackness  of 
the  deep  sea. 

In  a  curious  way,  the  colors  of  marine  animals  tend  to  be  re¬ 
lated  to  the  zone  in  which  they  live.  Fishes  of  the  surface  waters, 
like  the  mackerel  and  herring,  often  are  blue  or  green;  so  are 
the  floats  of  the  Portuguese  men-of-war  and  the  azure-tinted 
wings  of  the  swimming  snails.  Down  below  the  diatom  meadows 
and  the  drifting  sargassum  weed,  where  the  water  becomes  ever 
more  deeply,  brilliantly  blue,  many  creatures  are  crystal  clear. 
Their  glassy,  ghostly  forms  blend  with  their  surroundings  and 
make  it  easier  for  them  to  elude  the  ever-present,  ever-hungry 
enemy.  Such  are  the  transparent  hordes  of  the  arrowworms  or 
glassworms,  the  comb  jellies,  and  the  larvae  of  many  fishes. 

At  a  thousand  feet,  and  on  down  to  the  very  end  of  the  sun’s 
rays,  silvery  fishes  are  common,  and  many  others  are  red,  drab 
brown,  or  black.  Pteropods  are  a  dark  violet.  Arrowworms,  whose 
relatives  in  the  upper  layers  are  colorless,  are  here  a  deep  red. 
Jellyfish  medusae,  which  above  would  be  transparent,  at  a  depth 
of  1000  feet  are  a  deep  brown. 


The  Sunless  Sea 


49 


At  depths  greater  than  1 500  feet,  all  the  fishes  are  black,  deep 
violet,  or  brown,  but  the  prawns  wear  amazing  hues  of  red,  scar¬ 
let,  and  purple.  Why,  no  one  can  say.  Since  all  the  red  rays  are 
strained  out  of  the  water  far  above  this  depth,  the  scarlet  raiment 
of  these  creatures  can  only  look  black  to  their  neighbors. 

The  deep  sea  has  its  stars,  and  perhaps  here  and  there  an 
eerie  and  transient  equivalent  of  moonlight,  for  the  mysterious 
phenomenon  of  luminescence  is  displayed  by  perhaps  half  of  all 
the  fishes  that  live  in  dimly  lit  or  darkened  waters,  and  by  many 
of  the  lower  forms  as  well.  Many  fishes  carry  luminous  torches 
that  can  be  turned  on  or  off  at  will,  presumably  helping  them 
find  or  pursue  their  prey.  Others  have  rows  of  lights  over  their 
bodies,  in  patterns  that  vary  from  species  to  species  and  may  be 
a  sort  of  recognition  mark  or  badge  by  which  the  bearer  can  be 
known  as  friend  or  enemy.  The  deep-sea  squid  ejects  a  spurt  of 
fluid  that  becomes  a  luminous  cloud,  the  counterpart  of  the  fink’ 
of  his  shallow-water  relative. 

Down  beyond  the  reach  of  even  the  longest  and  strongest  of 
the  sun's  rays,  the  eyes  of  fishes  become  enlarged,  as  though  to 
make  the  most  of  any  chance  illumination  of  whatever  sort,  or 
they  may  become  telescopic,  large  of  lens,  and  protruding.  In 
deep-sea  fishes,  hunting  always  in  dark  waters,  the  eyes  tend  to 
lose  the  'cones’  or  color-perceiving  cells  of  the  retina,  and  to  in¬ 
crease  the  'rods,’  which  perceive  dim  light.  Exactly  the  same 
modification  is  seen  on  land  among  the  strictly  nocturnal 
prowlers  which,  like  abyssal  fish,  never  see  the  sunlight. 

In  their  world  of  darkness,  it  would  seem  likely  that  some  of 
the  animals  might  have  become  blind,  as  has  happened  to  some 
cave  fauna.  So,  indeed,  many  of  them  have,  compensating  for 
the  lack  of  eyes  with  marvelously  developed  feelers  and  long, 
slender  fins  and  processes  with  which  they  grope  their  way,  like 
so  many  blind  men  with  canes,  their  whole  knowledge  of  friends,, 
enemies,  or  food  coming  to  them  through  the  sense  of  touch. 

The  last  traces  of  plant  life  are  left  behind  in  the  thin  upper 
layer  of  water,  for  no  plant  can  live  below  about  600  feet  even 
in  very  clear  water,  and  few  find  enough  sunlight  for  their  food¬ 
manufacturing  activities  below  200  feet.  Since  no  animal  can 


5° 


Mother  Sea 


make  its  own  food,  the  creatures  of  the  deeper  waters  live  a 
strange,  almost  parasitic  existence  of  utter  dependence  on  the 
upper  layers.  These  hungry  carnivores  prey  fiercely  and  relent¬ 
lessly  upon  each  other,  yet  the  whole  community  is  ultimately 
dependent  upon  the  slow  rain  of  descending  food  particles  from 
above.  The  components  of  this  never-ending  rain  are  the  dead 
and  dying  plants  and  animals  from  the  surface,  or  from  one  of 
the  intermediate  layers.  For  each  of  the  horizontal  zones  or  com¬ 
munities  of  the  sea  that  he,  in  tier  after  tier,  between  the  surface 
and  the  sea  bottom,  the  food  supply  is  different  and  in  general 
poorer  than  for  the  layer  above.  There  is  a  hint  of  the  fierce  and 
uncompromising  competition  for  food  in  the  saber-toothed  jaws 
of  some  of  the  small,  dragonlike  fishes  of  the  deeper  waters,  in 
the  immense  mouths  and  in  the  elastic  and  distensible  bodies 
that  make  it  possible  for  a  fish  to  swallow  another  several  times 
its  size,  enjoying  swift  repletion  after  a  long  fast. 

Pressure,  darkness,  and— we  should  have  added  only  a  few 
years  ago— silence,  are  the  conditions  of  life  in  the  deep  sea.  But 
we  know  now  that  the  conception  of  the  sea  as  a  silent  place  is 
wholly  false.  Wide  experience  with  hydrophones  and  other  lis¬ 
tening  devices  for  the  detection  of  submarines  has  proved  that, 
around  the  shore  lines  of  much  of  the  world,  there  is  an  extraor¬ 
dinary  uproar  produced  by  fishes,  shrimps,  porpoises,  and  prob¬ 
ably  other  forms  not  yet  identified.  There  has  been  little  in¬ 
vestigation  as  yet  of  sound  in  the  deep,  offshore  areas,  but  when 
the  crew  of  the  Atlantis  lowered  a  hydrophone  into  deep  water 
off  Bermuda,  they  recorded  strange  mewing  sounds,  shrieks,  and 
ghostly  moans,  the  sources  of  which  have  not  been  traced.  But 
fish  of  shallower  zones  have  been  captured  and  confined  in 
aquaria,  where  their  voices  have  been  recorded  for  comparison 
with  sounds  heard  at  sea,  and  in  many  cases  satisfactory  identi¬ 
fication  can  be  made. 

During  the  Second  World  War  the  hydrophone  network  set 
up  by  the  United  States  Navy  to  protect  the  entrance  to  Chesa¬ 
peake  Bay  was  temporarily  made  useless  when,  in  the  spring  of 
1942,  the  speakers  at  the  surface  began  to  give  forth,  every 
evening,  a  sound  described  as  being  like  ‘a  pneumatic  drill  tear- 


The  Sunless  Sea

ing  up  pavement/  The  extraneous  noises  that  came  over  the 
hydrophones  completely  masked  the  sounds  of  the  passage  of 
ships.  Eventually  it  was  discovered  that  the  sounds  were  the 
voices  of  fish  known  as  croakers,  which  in  the  spring  move  into 
Chesapeake  Bay  from  their  offshore  wintering  grounds.  As  soon 
as  the  noise  had  been  identified  and  analyzed,  it  was  possible  to 
screen  it  out  with  an  electric  filter,  so  that  once  more  only  the 
sounds  of  ships  came  through  the  speakers. 

Later  in  the  same  year,  a  chorus  of  croakers  was  discovered  off 
the  pier  of  the  Scripps  Institution  at  La  Jolla.  Every  year  from 
May  until  late  September  the  evening  chorus  begins  about  sun¬ 
set,  and  'increases  gradually  to  a  steady  uproar  of  harsh  froggy 
croaks,  with  a  background  of  soft  drumming.  This  continues  un¬ 
abated  for  two  to  three  hours  and  finally  tapers  off  to  individual 
outbursts  at  rare  intervals/  Several  species  of  croakers  isolated  in 
aquaria  gave  sounds  similar  to  the  ‘froggy  croaks/  but  the  authors 
of  the  soft  background  drumming— presumably  another  species 
of  croaker— have  not  yet  been  discovered. 

One  of  the  most  extraordinarily  widespread  sounds  of  the 
undersea  is  the  crackling,  sizzling  sound,  like  dry  twigs  burning 
or  fat  frying,  heard  near  beds  of  the  snapping  shrimp.  This  is  a 
small,  round  shrimp,  about  half  an  inch  in  diameter,  with  one 
very  large  claw  which  it  uses  to  stun  its  prey.  The  shrimp  are 
forever  clicking  the  two  joints  of  this  claw  together,  and  it  is  the 
thousands  of  clicks  that  collectively  produce  the  noise  known 
as  shrimp  crackle.  No  one  had  any  idea  the  little  snapping 
shrimps  were  so  abundant  or  so  widely  distributed  until  their 
signals  began  to  be  picked  up  on  hydrophones.  They  have  been 
heard  all  over  a  broad  band  that  extends  around  the  world,  be¬ 
tween  latitudes  350  N  and  350  S,  (for  example,  from  Cape  Hat- 
teras  to  Buenos  Aires)  in  ocean  waters  less  than  30  fathoms  deep. 

Mammals  as  well  as  fishes  and  crustaceans  contribute  to  the 
undersea  chorus.  Biologists  listening  through  a  hydrophone  in  an 
estuary  of  the  St.  Lawrence  River  heard  'high-pitched  resonant 
whistles  and  squeals,  varied  with  the  ticking  and  clucking  sounds 
slightly  reminiscent  of  a  string  orchestra  tuning  up,  as  well  as 
mewing  and  occasional  chirps/  This  remarkable  medley  of 


Mother  Sea 


sounds  was  heard  only  while  schools  of  the  white  porpoise  were 
seen  passing  up  or  down  the  river,  and  so  was  assumed  to  be 
produced  by  them.5 

The  mysteriousness,  the  eerieness,  the  ancient  unchangingness 
of  the  great  depths  have  led  many  people  to  suppose  that  some 
very  old  forms  of  life— some  living  fossils'— may  be  lurking  un¬ 
discovered  in  the  deep  ocean.  Some  such  hope  may  have  been  in 
the  minds  of  the  Challenger  scientists.  The  forms  they  brought 
up  in  their  nets  were  weird  enough,  and  most  of  them  had  never 
before  been  seen  by  man.  But  basically  they  were  modern  types. 
There  was  nothing  like  the  trilobites  of  Cambrian  time  or  the  sea 
scorpions  of  the  Silurian,  nothing  reminiscent  of  the  great  marine 
reptiles  that  invaded  the  sea  in  the  Mesozoic.  Instead,  there  were 
modern  fishes,  squids,  and  shrimps,  strangely  and  grotesquely 
modified,  to  be  sure,  for  life  in  the  difficult  deep-sea  world,  but 
clearly  types  that  have  developed  in  rather  recent  geologic  time. 

Far  from  being  the  original  home  of  life,  the  deep  sea  has 
probably  been  inhabited  for  a  relatively  short  time.  While  life 
was  developing  and  flourishing  in  the  surface  waters,  along  the 
shores,  and  perhaps  in  the  rivers  and  swamps,  two  immense  re¬ 
gions  of  the  earth  still  forbade  invasion  by  living  things.  These 
were  the  continents  and  the  abyss.  As  we  have  seen,  the  im¬ 
mense  difficulties  of  surviving  on  land  were  first  overcome  by 
colonists  from  the  sea  about  300  million  years  ago.  The  abyss, 
with  its  unending  darkness,  its  crushing  pressures,  its  glacial  cold, 
presented  even  more  formidable  difficulties.  Probably  the  suc¬ 
cessful  invasion  of  this  region— at  least  by  higher  forms  of  life 
—occurred  somewhat  later. 

Yet  in  recent  years  there  have  been  one  or  two  significant  hap¬ 
penings  that  have  kept  alive  the  hope  that  the  deep  sea  may, 
after  all,  conceal  strange  links  with  the  past.  In  December  1938, 
off  the  southeast  tip  of  Africa,  an  amazing  fish  was  caught  alive 
in  a  trawl— a  fish  that  was  supposed  to  have  been  dead  for  at  least 
60  million  years!  This  is  to  say,  the  last  known  fossil  remains 
of  its  kind  date  from  the  Cretaceous,  and  no  living  example  had 
been  recognized  in  historic  time  until  this  lucky  net-haul. 

The  fishermen  who  brought  it  up  in  their  trawl  from  a  depth 


The  Sunless  Sea

of  only  40  fathoms  realized  that  this  five-foot,  bright  blue  fish, 
with  its  large  head  and  strangely  shaped  scales,  fins,  and  tail, 
was  different  from  anything  they  had  ever  caught  before,  and 
on  their  return  to  port  they  took  it  to  the  nearest  museum.  This 
single  specimen  of  Latimeria,  as  the  fish  was  christened,  is  so 
far  the  only  one  that  has  been  captured,  and  it  seems  a  reason¬ 
able  guess  that  it  may  inhabit  depths  below  those  ordinarily 
fished,  and  that  the  South  African  specimen  was  a  stray  from  its 
usual  habitat.6 

Occasionally  a  very  primitive  type  of  shark,  known  from  its 
puckered  gills  as  a  ‘frillshark/  is  taken  in  waters  between  a  quar¬ 
ter  of  a  mile  and  half  a  mile  down.  Most  of  these  have  been 
caught  in  Norwegian  and  Japanese  waters — there  are  only  about 
50  preserved  in  the  museums  of  Europe  and  America— but  re¬ 
cently  one  was  captured  off  Santa  Barbara,  California.  The  frill- 
shark  has  many  anatomical  features  similar  to  those  of  the 
ancient  sharks  that  lived  25  to  30  million  years  ago.  It  has  too 
many  gills  and  too  few  dorsal  fins  for  a  modern  shark,  and  its 
teeth,  like  those  of  fossil  sharks,  are  three-pronged  and  briarlike. 
Some  ichthyologists  regard  it  as  a  relic  derived  from  very  ancient 
shark  ancestors  that  have  died  out  in  the  upper  waters  but, 
through  this  single  species,  are  still  carrying  on  their  struggle  for 
earthly  survival,  in  the  quiet  of  the  deep  sea. 

Possibly  there  are  other  such  anachronisms  lurking  down  in 
these  regions  of  which  we  know  so  little,  but  they  are  likely  to 
be  few  and  scattered.  The  terms  of  existence  in  these  deep  waters 
are  far  too  uncompromising  to  support  life  unless  that  life  is 
plastic,  molding  itself  constantly  to  the  harsh  conditions,  seizing 
every  advantage  that  makes  possible  the  survival  of  living  pro¬ 
toplasm  in  a  world  only  a  little  less  hostile  than  the  black  reaches 
of  interplanetary  space.

SAND-STREWN  CAVERNS,  COOL  AND  DEEP, 
WHERE  THE  WINDS  ARE  ALL  ASLEEP. 

— Matthew  Arnold 


^  HE  first  European  ever  to  sail  across  the  wide  Pacific  was 
curious  about  the  hidden  worlds  beneath  his  ship.  Between  the 
two  coral  islands  of  St.  Paul  and  Los  Tiburones  in  the  Tuamotu 
Archipelago,  Magellan  ordered  his  sounding  line  to  be  lowered. 
It  was  the  conventional  line  used  by  explorers  of  the  day,  no 
more  than  200  fathoms  long.  It  did  not  touch  bottom,  and 
Magellan  declared  that  he  was  over  the  deepest  part  of  the  ocean. 
Of  course  he  was  completely  mistaken,  but  the  occasion  was 
none  the  less  historic.  It  was  the  first  time  in  the  history  of  the 
world  that  a  navigator  had  attempted  to  sound  the  depths  of 
the  open  ocean. 

Three  centuries  later,  in  the  year  1839,  Sir  James  Clark  Ross 
set  out  from  England  in  command  of  two  ships  with  names  of 
dark  foreboding,  the  Erebus  and  the  Terror ,  bound  for  the  ‘ut¬ 
most  navigable  limits  of  the  Antarctic  Ocean/  As  he  proceeded 
on  his  course  he  tried  repeatedly  to  obtain  soundings,  but  failed 
for  lack  of  a  proper  line.  Finally  he  had  one  constructed  on 
board,  of  three  thousand  six  hundred  fathoms,  or  rather  more

than  four  miles  in  length.  .  .  .  On  the  3rd  of  January,  in  latitude 
270  26'  S.,  longitude  170  29'  W.,  the  weather  and  all  other  cir¬ 
cumstances  being  propitious,  we  succeeded  in  obtaining  sound¬ 
ings  with  two  thousand  four  hundred  and  twenty-five  fathoms  of 
line,  a  depression  of  the  bed  of  the  ocean  beneath  its  surface 
very  little  short  of  the  elevation  of  Mount  Blanc  above  it/  This 
was  the  first  successful  abyssal  sounding. 

But  taking  soundings  in  the  deep  ocean  was,  and  long  re¬ 
mained,  a  laborious  and  time-consuming  task,  and  knowledge  of 
the  undersea  topography  lagged  considerably  behind  our  ac¬ 
quaintance  with  the  landscape  of  the  near  side  of  the  moon. 
Over  the  years,  methods  were  improved.  For  the  heavy  hemp  line 
used  by  Ross,  Maury  of  the  United  States  Navy  substituted  a 
strong  twine,  and  in  1870  Lord  Kelvin  used  piano  wire.  Even 
with  improved  gear  a  deep-water  sounding  required  several 
hours  or  sometimes  an  entire  day.  By  1854,  when  Maury  col¬ 
lected  all  available  records,  only  180  deep  soundings  were  avail¬ 
able  from  the  Atlantic,  and  by  the  time  that  modern  echo  sound¬ 
ing  was  developed,  the  total  that  had  been  taken  from  all  the 
ocean  basins  of  the  world  was  only  about  1 3,000.  This  is  roughly 
one  sounding  for  an  area  of  6000  square  miles. 

Now  hundreds  of  vessels  are  equipped  with  sonic  sounding 
instruments  that  trace  a  continuous  profile  of  the  bottom  be¬ 
neath  the  moving  ship  (although  only  a  few  can  obtain  profiles 
at  depths  greater  than  2000  fathoms  7 ) .  Soundings  are  accumu¬ 
lating  much  faster  than  they  can  be  plotted  on  the  charts.  Little 
by  little,  like  the  details  of  a  huge  map  being  filled  in  by  an 
artist,  the  hidden  contours  of  the  ocean  are  emerging.  But,  even 
with  this  recent  progress,  it  will  be  years  before  an  accurate  and 
detailed  relief  map  of  the  ocean  basins  can  be  constructed. 

The  general  bottom  topography  is,  however,  well  established. 
Once  we  have  passed  the  tide  lines,  the  three  great  geographic 
provinces  of  ocean  are  the  continental  shelves,  the  continental 
slopes,  and  the  floor  of  the  deep  sea.  Each  of  these  regions  is  as 
different  from  the  others  as  an  arctic  tundra  from  a  range  of  the 
Rocky  Mountains. 

The  continental  shelf  is  of  the  sea,  yet  of  all  regions  of  the 


;6 


Mother  Sea 


ocean  it  is  most  like  the  land.  Sunlight  penetrates  to  all  but  its 
deepest  parts.  Plants  drift  in  the  waters  above  it;  seaweeds  cling 
to  its  rocks  and  sway  to  the  passage  of  the  waves.  Familiar  fishes 
—unlike  the  weird  monsters  of  the  abyss — move  over  its  plains 
like  herds  of  cattle.  Much  of  its  substance  is  derived  from  the 
land— the  sand  and  the  rock  fragments  and  the  rich  topsoil  car¬ 
ried  by  running  water  to  the  sea  and  gently  deposited  on  the 
shelf.  Its  submerged  valleys  and  hills,  in  appropriate  parts  of  the 
world,  have  been  carved  by  glaciers  into  a  topography  much  like 
the  northern  landscapes  we  know  and  the  terrain  is  strewn  with 
rocks  and  gravel  deposited  by  the  moving  ice  sheets.  Indeed 
many  parts  (or  perhaps  all)  of  the  shelf  have  been  dry  land  in 
the  geologic  past,  for  a  comparatively  slight  fall  of  sea  level 
has  sufficed,  time  and  again,  to  expose  it  to  wind  and  sun  and 
rain.  The  Grand  Banks  of  Newfoundland  rose  above  the  ancient 
seas  and  were  submerged  again.  The  Dogger  Bank  of  the  North 
Sea  shelf  was  once  a  forested  land  inhabited  by  prehistoric 
beasts;  now  its  'forests'  are  seaweeds  and  its  'beasts'  are  fishes. 

Of  all  parts  of  the  sea,  the  continental  shelves  are  perhaps 
most  directly  important  to  man  as  a  source  of  material  things. 
The  great  fisheries  of  the  world,  with  only  a  few  exceptions,  are 
confined  to  the  relatively  shallow  waters  over  the  continental 
shelves.  Seaweeds  are  gathered  from  their  submerged  plains  to 
make  scores  of  substances  used  in  foods,  drugs,  and  articles  of 
commerce.  As  the  petroleum  reserves  left  on  continental  areas 
by  ancient  seas  become  depleted,  petroleum  geologists  look  more 
and  more  to  the  oil  that  may  lie,  as  yet  unmapped  and  unex¬ 
ploited,  under  these  bordering  lands  of  the  sea. 

The  shelves  begin  at  the  tidelines  and  extend  seaward  as 
gently  sloping  plains.  The  100-fathom  contour  used  to  be  taken 
as  the  boundary  between  the  continental  shelf  and  the  slope; 
now  it  is  customary  to  place  the  division  wherever  the  gentle 
declivity  of  the  shelf  changes  abruptly  to  a  steeper  descent 
toward  abyssal  depths.  The  world  over,  the  average  depth  at 
which  this  change  occurs  is  about  72  fathoms;  the  greatest  depth 
of  any  shelf  is  probably  200  to  300  fathoms. 

Nowhere  off  the  Pacific  coast  of  the  United  States  is  the  con- 


Hidden  Lands 


tinental  shelf  much  more  than  20  miles  wide — a  narrowness 
characteristic  of  coasts  bordered  by  young  mountains  perhaps 
still  in  the  process  of  formation.  On  the  American  east  coast, 
however,  north  of  Cape  Hatteras  the  shelf  is  as  much  as  1^0 
miles  wide.  But  at  Hatteras  and  off  southern  Florida  it  is  merely 
the  narrowest  of  thresholds  to  the  sea.  Here  its  scant  develop¬ 
ment  seems  to  be  related  to  the  press  of  that  great  and  rapidly 
flowing  river-in-the-sea,  the  Gulf  Stream,  which  at  these  places 
swings  close  inshore. 

The  widest  shelves  in  all  the  world  are  those  bordering  the 
Arctic.  The  Barents  Sea  shelf  is  750  miles  across.  It  is  also  rela¬ 
tively  deep,  lying  for  the  most  part  100  to  200  fathoms  below 
the  surface,  as  though  its  floor  had  sagged  and  been  down- 
warped  under  the  load  of  glacial  ice.  It  is  scored  by  deep  troughs 
between  which  banks  and  islands  rise— further  evidence  of  the 
work  of  the  ice.  The  deepest  shelves  surround  the  Antarctic  con¬ 
tinent,  where  soundings  in  many  areas  show  depths  of  several 
hundred  fathoms  near  the  coast  and  continuing  out  across  the 
shelf. 

Once  beyond  the  edge  of  the  shelf,  as  we  visualize  the  steeper 
declivities  of  the  continental  slope,  we  begin  to  feel  the  mystery 
and  the  alien  quality  of  the  deep  sea— the  gathering  darkness, 
the  growing  pressure,  the  starkness  of  a  seascape  in  which  all 
plant  life  has  been  left  behind  and  there  are  only  the  unrelieved 
contours  of  rock  and  clay,  of  mud  and  sand. 

Biologically  the  world  of  the  continental  slope,  like  that  of  the 
abyss,  is  a  world  of  animals— a  world  of  carnivores  where  each 
creature  preys  upon  another.  For  no  plants  live  here,  and  the 
only  ones  that  drift  down  from  above  are  the  dead  husks  of  the 
flora  of  the  sunlit  waters.  Most  of  the  slopes  are  below  the  zone 
of  surface  wave  action,  yet  the  moving  water  masses  of  the  ocean 
currents  press  against  them  in  their  coastwise  passage;  the  pulse 
of  the  tide  beats  against  them;  they  feel  the  surge  of  the  deep, 
internal  waves. 

Geographically,  the  slopes  are  the  most  imposing  features  of 
all  the  surface  of  the  earth.  They  are  the  walls  of  the  deep-sea 
basins.  They  are  the  farthermost  bounds  of  the  continents,  the 


Mother  Sea 


58 

true  place  of  beginning  of  the  sea.  The  slopes  are  the  longest 
and  highest  escarpments  found  anywhere  on  the  earth;  their 
average  height  is  12,000  feet,  but  in  some  places  they  reach  the 
immense  height  of  30,000  feet.  No  continental  mountain  range 
has  so  great  a  difference  of  elevation  between  its  foothills  and 
its  peaks. 

Nor  is  the  grandeur  of  slope  topography  confined  to  steepness 
and  height.  The  slopes  are  the  site  of  one  of  the  most  mysterious 
features  of  the  sea.  These  are  the  submarine  canyons  with  their 
steep  cliffs  and  winding  valleys  cutting  back  into  the  walls  of  the 
continents.  The  canyons  have  now  been  found  in  so  many  parts 
of  the  world  that  when  soundings  have  been  taken  in  presently 
unexplored  areas  we  shall  probably  find  that  they  are  of  world¬ 
wide  occurrence.  Geologists  say  that  some  of  the  canyons  were 
formed  well  within  the  most  recent  division  of  geologic  time, 
the  Cenozoic,  most  of  them  probably  within  the  Pleistocene,  a 
million  years  ago,  or  less.  But  how  and  by  what  they  were  carved, 
no  one  can  say.  Their  origin  is  one  of  the  most  hotly  disputed 
problems  of  the  ocean. 

Only  the  fact  that  the  canyons  are  deeply  hidden  in  the  dark¬ 
ness  of  the  sea  (many  extending  a  mile  or  more  below  present 
sea  level)  prevents  them  from  being  classed  with  the  world's 
most  spectacular  scenery.  The  comparison  with  the  Grand  Can¬ 
yon  of  the  Colorado  is  irresistible.  Like  river-cut  land  canyons, 
sea  canyons  are  deep  and  winding  valleys,  V-shaped  in  cross 
section,  their  walls  sloping  down  at  a  steep  angle  to  a  narrow 
floor.  The  location  of  many  of  the  largest  ones  suggests  a  past 
connection  with  some  of  the  great  rivers  of  the  earth  of  our  time. 
Hudson  Canyon,  one  of  the  largest  on  the  Atlantic  coast,  is 
separated  by  only  a  shallow  sill  from  a  long  valley  that  wanders 
for  more  than  a  hundred  miles  across  the  continental  shelf, 
originating  at  the  entrance  of  New  York  Harbor  and  the  estuary 
of  the  Hudson  River.  There  are  large  canyons  off  the  Congo,  the 
Indus,  the  Ganges,  the  Columbia,  the  Sao  Francisco,  and  the 
Mississippi,  according  to  Francis  Shepard,  one  of  the  principal 
students  of  the  canyon  problem.  Monterey  Canyon  in  Califor¬ 
nia,  Professor  Shepard  points  out,  is  located  off  an  old  mouth  of 


Hidden  Lands 


59 


the  Salinas  River;  the  Cap  Breton  Canyon  in  France  appears  to 
have  no  relation  to  an  existing  river  but  actually  lies  off  an  old 
fifteenth-century  mouth  of  the  Adour  River. 

Their  shape  and  apparent  relation  to  existing  rivers  have  led 
Shepard  to  suggest  that  the  submarine  canyons  were  cut  by 
rivers  at  some  time  when  their  gorges  were  above  sea  level.  The 
relative  youth  of  the  canyons  seems  to  relate  them  to  some  hap¬ 
penings  in  the  world  of  the  Ice  Age.  It  is  generally  agreed  that 
sea  level  was  lowered  during  the  existence  of  the  great  glaciers, 
for  water  was  withdrawn  from  the  sea  and  frozen  in  the  ice 
sheet.  But  most  geologists  say  that  the  sea  was  lowered  only  a 
few  hundred  feet — not  the  mile  that  would  be  necessary  to  ac¬ 
count  for  the  canyons.  According  to  one  theory,  there  were 
heavy  submarine  mud  flows  during  the  times  when  the  glaciers 
were  advancing  and  sea  level  fell  the  lowest;  mud  stirred  up  by 
waves  poured  down  the  continental  slopes  and  scoured  out  the 
canyons.  Since  none  of  the  present  evidence  is  conclusive,  how¬ 
ever,  we  simply  do  not  know  how  the  canyons  came  into  being, 
and  their  mystery  remains.8 

The  floor  of  the  deep  ocean  basins  is  probably  as  old  as  the 
sea  itself.  In  all  the  hundreds  of  millions  of  years  that  have  inter¬ 
vened  since  the  formation  of  the  abyss,  these  deeper  depressions 
have  never,  as  far  as  we  can  learn,  been  drained  of  their  covering 
waters.  While  the  bordering  shelves  of  the  continents  have 
known,  in  alternating  geologic  ages,  now  the  surge  of  waves  and 
again  the  eroding  tools  of  rain  and  wind  and  frost,  always  the 
abyss  has  lain  under  the  all-enveloping  cover  of  miles-deep 
water. 

But  this  does  not  mean  that  the  contours  of  the  abyss  have 
remained  unchanged  since  the  day  of  its  creation.  The  floor  of 
the  sea,  like  the  stuff  of  the  continents,  is  a  thin  crust  over  the 
plastic  mantle  of  the  earth.  It  is  here  thrust  up  into  folds  and 
wrinkles  as  the  interior  cools  by  imperceptible  degrees  and 
shrinks  away  from  its  covering  layer;  there  it  falls  away  into  deep 
trenches  in  answer  to  the  stresses  and  strains  of  crustal  adjust¬ 
ment;  and  again  it  pushes  up  into  the  conelike  shapes  of  under¬ 
sea  mountains  as  volcanoes  boil  upward  from  fissures  in  the  crust.

Mother  Sea 


Until  very  recent  years,  it  has  been  the  fashion  of  geographers 
and  oceanographers  to  speak  of  the  floor  of  the  deep  sea  as  a 
vast  and  comparatively  level  plain.  The  existence  of  certain  topo¬ 
graphic  features  was  recognized,  as,  for  example,  the  Atlantic 
Ridge  and  a  number  of  very  deep  depressions  like  the  Mindanao 
Trench  off  the  Philippines.  But  these  were  considered  to  be 
rather  exceptional  interruptions  of  a  flat  floor  that  otherwise 
showed  little  relief. 

This  legend  of  the  flatness  of  the  ocean  floor  was  thoroughly 
destroyed  by  the  Swedish  Deep-Sea  Expedition,  which  sailed 
from  Goteborg  in  the  summer  of  1947  and  spent  the  following 
15  months  exploring  the  bed  of  the  ocean.  While  the  Swedish 
Albatross  was  crossing  the  Atlantic  in  the  direction  of  the  Pan¬ 
ama  Canal,  the  scientists  aboard  were  astonished  by  the  extreme 
ruggedness  of  the  ocean  floor.  Rarely  did  their  fathometers 
reveal  more  than  a  few  consecutive  miles  of  level  plain.  Instead 
the  bottom  profile  rose  and  fell  in  curious  steps  constructed  on  a 
Gargantuan  scale,  half  a  mile  to  several  miles  wide.  In  the  Pa¬ 
cific,  the  uneven  bottom  contours  made  it  difficult  to  use  many 
of  the  oceanographic  instruments.  More  than  one  coring  tube 
was  left  behind,  probably  lodged  in  some  undersea  crevasse. 

One  of  the  exceptions  to  a  hilly  or  mountainous  floor  was  in 
the  Indian  Ocean,  where,  southeast  of  Ceylon,  the  Albatross  ran 
for  several  hundred  miles  across  a  level  plain.  Attempts  to  take 
bottom  samples  from  this  plain  had  little  success,  for  the  corers 
were  broken  repeatedly,  suggesting  that  the  bottom  was  hard¬ 
ened  lava  and  that  the  whole  vast  plateau  might  have  been 
formed  by  the  outpourings  of  submarine  volcanoes  on  a  stupen¬ 
dous  scale.  Perhaps  this  lava  plain  under  the  Indian  Ocean  is  an 
undersea  counterpart  of  the  great  basaltic  plateau  in  the  eastern 
part  of  the  State  of  Washington,  or  of  the  Deccan  plateau  of 
India,  built  of  basaltic  rock  10,000  feet  thick. 

In  parts  of  the  Atlantic  basin  the  Woods  Hole  Oceanographic 
Institution's  vessel  Atlantis  has  found  a  flat  plain  occupying 
much  of  the  ocean  basin  from  Bermuda  to  the  Atlantic  Ridge 
and  also  to  the  east  of  the  Ridge.  Only  a  series  of  knolls,  prob¬ 
ably  of  volcanic  origin,  interrupts  the  even  contours  of  the  plains.

These  particular  regions  are  so  flat  that  it  seems  they  must  have 
remained  largely  undisturbed,  receiving  deposits  of  sediments 
over  an  immense  period  of  time. 

The  deepest  depressions  on  the  floor  of  the  sea  occur  not  in 
the  centers  of  the  oceanic  basins  as  might  be  expected,  but  near 
the  continents.  One  of  the  deepest  trenches  of  all,  the  Minda¬ 
nao,  lies  east  of  the  Philippines  and  is  an  awesome  pit  in  the  sea, 
six  and  a  half  miles  deep.9  The  Tuscarora  Trench  east  of  Japan, 
nearly  as  deep,  is  one  of  a  series  of  long,  narrow  trenches  that 
border  the  convex  outer  rim  of  a  chain  of  islands  including  the 
Bonins,  the  Marianas,  and  the  Palaus.  On  the  seaward  side  of 
the  Aleutian  Islands  is  another  group  of  trenches.  The  greatest 
deeps  of  the  Atlantic  lie  adjacent  to  the  islands  of  the  West 
Indies,  and  also  below  Cape  Horn,  where  other  curving  chains 
of  islands  go  out  like  stepping  stones  into  the  Southern  Ocean. 
And  again  in  the  Indian  Ocean  the  curving  island  arcs  of  the 
East  Indies  have  their  accompanying  deeps. 

Always  there  is  this  association  of  island  arcs  and  deep 
trenches,  and  always  the  two  occur  only  in  areas  of  volcanic  un¬ 
rest.  The  pattern,  it  is  now  agreed,  is  associated  with  mountain 
making  and  the  sharp  adjustments  of  the  sea  floor  that  accom¬ 
pany  it.  On  the  concave  side  of  the  island  arcs  are  rows  of  vol¬ 
canoes.  On  the  convex  side  there  is  a  sharp  down-bending  of  the 
ocean  floor,  which  results  in  the  deep  trenches  with  their  broad 
V-shape.  The  two  forces  seem  to  be  in  a  kind  of  uneasy  balance: 
the  upward  folding  of  the  earth’s  crust  to  form  mountains,  and 
the  thrusting  down  of  the  crust  of  the  sea  floor  into  the  basaltic 
substance  of  the  underlying  layer.  Sometimes,  it  seems,  the 
down-thrust  mass  of  granite  has  shattered  and  risen  again  to  form 
islands.  Such  is  the  supposed  origin  of  Barbados  in  the  West 
Indies  and  of  Timor  in  the  East  Indies.  Both  have  deep-sea 
deposits,  as  though  they  had  once  been  part  of  the  sea  floor.  Yet 
this  must  be  exceptional.  In  the  words  of  the  great  geologist 
Daly, 

Another  property  of  the  earth  is  its  ability  ...  to  resist  shear¬ 
ing  pressures  indefinitely  .  .  .  The  continents,  overlooking  the  sea 
bottom,  stubbornly  refuse  to  creep  thither.  The  rock  under  the 


62 


Mother  Sea 

Pacific  is  strong  enough  to  bear,  with  no  known  time  limit,  the 
huge  stresses  involved  by  the  down-thrust  of  the  crust  at  the 
Tonga  Deep,  and  by  the  erection  of  the  10,000-meter  dome  of 
lavas  and  other  volcanic  products  represented  in  the  island  of 
Hawaii.* 

The  least-known  region  of  the  ocean  floor  lies  under  the  Arctic 
Sea.  The  physical  difficulties  of  sounding  here  are  enormous.  A 
permanent  sheet  of  ice,  as  much  as  fifteen  feet  thick,  covers  the 
whole  central  basin  and  is  impenetrable  to  ships.  Peary  took  sev¬ 
eral  soundings  in  the  course  of  his  dash  to  the  Pole  by  dog  team 
in  1909.  On  one  attempt  a  few  miles  from  the  Pole  the  wire 
broke  with  1500  fathoms  out.  In  1927  Sir  Hubert  Wilkins  landed 
his  plane  on  the  ice  550  miles  north  of  Point  Barrow  and  ob¬ 
tained  a  single  echo  sounding  of  2975  fathoms,  the  deepest  ever 
recorded  from  the  Arctic  Sea.  Vessels  deliberately  frozen  into  the 
ice  (such  as  the  Norwegian  Fram  and  the  Russian  Sedov  and 
Sadko)  in  order  to  drift  with  it  across  the  basin  have  obtained 
most  of  the  depth  records  available  for  the  central  parts.  In  1937 
and  1938  Russian  scientists  were  landed  near  the  Pole  and  sup¬ 
plied  by  plane  while  they  lived  on  the  ice,  drifting  with  it.  These 
men  took  nearly  a  score  of  deep  soundings. 

The  most  daring  plan  for  sounding  the  Arctic  Sea  was  con¬ 
ceived  by  Wilkins,  who  actually  set  out  in  the  submarine  Nauti¬ 
lus  in  193 1  with  the  intention  of  traveling  beneath  the  ice  across 
the  entire  basin  from  Spitsbergen  to  Bering  Strait.  Mechanical 
failure  of  the  diving  equipment  a  few  days  after  the  Nautilus 
left  Spitsbergen  prevented  the  execution  of  the  plan.  By  the 
middle  1940^,  the  total  of  soundings  for  deep  arctic  areas  by  all 
methods  was  only  about  150,  leaving  most  of  the  top  of  the 
world  an  unsounded  sea  whose  contours  can  only  be  guessed. 
Soon  after  the  close  of  the  Second  World  War,  the  United 
States  Navy  began  tests  of  a  new  method  of  obtaining  soundings 
through  the  ice,  which  may  provide  the  key  to  the  arctic  riddle. 
One  interesting  speculation  to  be  tested  by  future  soundings  is 
that  the  mountain  chain  that  bisects  the  Atlantic,  and  has  been

supposed  to  reach  its  northern  terminus  at  Iceland,  may  actually 
continue  across  the  arctic  basin  to  the  coast  of  Russia.  The  belt 
of  earthquake  epicenters  that  follows  the  Atlantic  Ridge  seems 
to  extend  across  the  Arctic  Sea,  and  where  there  are  submarine 
earthquakes  it  is  at  least  reasonable  to  guess  that  there  may  be 
mountainous  topography.10 

A  new  feature  on  recent  maps  of  undersea  relief— something 
never  included  before  the  1940’s— is  a  group  of  about  160  curi¬ 
ous,  flat-topped  sea  mounts  between  Hawaii  and  the  Marianas. 
It  happened  that  a  Princeton  University  geologist,  H.  H.  Hess, 
was  in  command  of  the  U.S.S.  Cape  Johnson  during  two  years  of 
the  wartime  cruising  of  this  vessel  in  the  Pacific.  Hess  was  imme¬ 
diately  struck  by  the  number  of  these  undersea  mountains  that 
appeared  on  the  fathograms  of  the  vessel.  Time  after  time,  as  the 
moving  pen  of  the  fathometer  traced  the  depth  contours  it 
would  abruptly  begin  to  rise  in  an  outline  of  a  steep-sided  sea 
mount,  standing  solitarily  on  the  bed  of  the  sea.  Unlike  a  typical 
volcanic  cone,  all  of  the  mounts  have  broad,  flat  tops,  as  though 
the  peaks  had  been  cut  off  and  planed  down  by  waves.  But  the 
summits  of  the  sea  mounts  are  anywhere  from  half  a  mile  to  a 
mile  or  more  below  the  surface  of  the  sea.  How  they  acquired 
their  flat-topped  contours  is  a  mystery  perhaps  as  great  as  that  of 
the  submarine  canyons. 

Unlike  the  scattered  sea  mounts,  the  long  ranges  of  undersea 
mountains  have  been  marked  on  the  charts  for  a  good  many 
years.  The  Atlantic  Ridge  was  discovered  about  a  century  ago. 
The  early  surveys  for  the  route  of  the  trans-Atlantic  cable  gave 
the  first  hint  of  its  existence.  The  German  oceanographic  vessel 
Meteor ,  which  crossed  and  recrossed  the  Atlantic  during  the 
1920’s,  established  the  contours  of  much  of  the  Ridge.  The  Af- 
lantis  of  the  Woods  Hole  Oceanographic  Institution  has  spent 
several  summers  in  an  exhaustive  study  of  the  Ridge  in  the  gen¬ 
eral  vicinity  of  the  Azores. 

Now  we  can  trace  the  outlines  of  this  great  mountain  range, 
and  dimly  we  begin  to  see  the  details  of  its  hidden  peaks  and  val¬ 
leys.  The  Ridge  rises  in  mid-Atlantic  near  Iceland.  From  this  far- 
northern  latitude  it  runs  south  midway  between  the  continents, 


Mother  Sea 


64 

crosses  the  equator  into  the  South  Atlantic,  and  continues  to 
about  50°  south  latitude,  where  it  turns  sharply  eastward  under 
the  tip  of  Africa  and  runs  toward  the  Indian  Ocean.  Its  general 
course  closely  parallels  the  coastlines  of  the  bordering  continents, 
even  to  the  definite  flexure  at  the  equator  between  the  hump  of 
Brazil  and  the  eastward-curving  coast  of  Africa.  To  some  people 
this  curvature  has  suggested  that  the  Ridge  was  once  part  of  a 
great  continental  mass,  left  behind  in  mid-ocean  when,  accord¬ 
ing  to  one  theory,  the  continents  of  North  and  South  America 
drifted  away  from  Europe  and  Africa.  However,  recent  work 
shows  that  on  the  floor  of  the  Atlantic  there  are  thick  masses  of 
sediments  which  must  have  required  hundreds  of  millions  of 
years  for  their  accumulation. 

Throughout  much  of  its  10,000-mile  length,  the  Atlantic 
Ridge  is  a  place  of  disturbed  and  uneasy  movements  of  the  ocean 
floor,  and  the  whole  Ridge  gives  the  impression  of  something 
formed  by  the  interplay  of  great,  opposing  forces.  From  its  west¬ 
ern  foothills  across  to  where  its  slopes  roll  down  into  the  eastern 
Atlantic  basin,  the  range  is  about  twice  as  wide  as  the  Andes  and 
several  times  the  width  of  the  Appalachians.  Near  the  equator 
a  deep  gash  cuts  across  it  from  east  to  west— the  Romanche 
Trench.  This  is  the  only  point  of  communication  between  the 
deep  basins  of  the  eastern  and  western  Atlantic,  although  among 
its  higher  peaks  there  are  other,  lesser  mountain  passes. 

The  greater  part  of  the  Ridge  is,  of  course,  submerged.  Its 
central  backbone  rises  some  5000  to  10,000  feet  above  the  sea 
floor,  but  another  mile  of  water  lies  above  most  of  its  summits. 
Yet  here  and  there  a  peak  thrusts  itself  up  out  of  the  darkness  of 
deep  water  and  pushes  above  the  surface  of  the  ocean.  These  are 
the  islands  of  the  mid-Atlantic.  The  highest  peak  of  the  Ridge  is 
Pico  Island  of  the  Azores.  It  rises  27,000  feet  above  the  ocean 
floor,  with  only  its  upper  7000  to  8000  feet  emergent.  The  sharp¬ 
est  peaks  of  the  Ridge  are  the  cluster  of  islets  known  as  the 
Rocks  of  St.  Paul,  near  the  equator.  The  entire  cluster  of  half  a 
dozen  islets  is  not  more  than  a  quarter  of  a  mile  across,  and  their 
rocky  slopes  drop  off  at  so  sheer  an  angle  that  water  more  than 
half  a  mile  deep  lies  only  a  few  feet  off  shore.  The  sultry  volcanic

bulk  of  Ascension  is  another  peak  of  the  Atlantic  Ridge;  so  are 
Tristan  da  Cunha,  Gough,  and  Bouvet. 

But  most  of  the  Ridge  lies  forever  hidden  from  human  eyes. 
Its  contours  have  been  made  out  only  indirectly  by  the  marvelous 
probings  of  sound  waves;  bits  of  its  substance  have  been  brought 
up  to  us  by  corers  and  dredges;  and  some  details  of  its  landscape 
have  been  photographed  with  deep-sea  cameras.  With  these  aids 
our  imaginations  can  picture  the  grandeur  of  the  undersea  moun¬ 
tains,  with  their  sheer  cliffs  and  rocky  terraces,  their  deep  valleys 
and  towering  peaks.  If  we  are  to  compare  the  ocean’s  mountains 
with  anything  on  the  continents,  we  must  think  of  terrestrial 
mountains  far  above  the  timber  line,  with  their  silent  snow-filled 
valleys  and  their  naked  rocks  swept  by  the  winds.  For  the  sea 
has  an  inverted  ‘timber  line’  or  plant  line,  below  which  no 
vegetation  can  grow.  The  slopes  of  the  undersea  mountains  are 
far  beyond  the  reach  of  the  sun’s  rays,  and  there  are  only  the 
bare  rocks,  and,  in  the  valleys,  the  deep  drifts  of  sediments  that 
have  been  silently  piling  up  through  the  millions  upon  millions 
of  years. 

Neither  the  Pacific  Ocean  nor  the  Indian  Ocean  has  any 
submerged  mountains  that  compare  in  length  with  the  Atlantic 
Ridge,  but  they  have  their  smaller  ranges.  The  Hawaiian  Islands 
are  the  peaks  of  a  mountain  range  that  runs  across  the  central 
Pacific  basin  for  a  distance  of  nearly  2000  miles.  The  Gilbert  and 
Marshall  islands  stand  on  the  shoulders  of  another  mid-Pacific 
mountain  chain.  In  the  eastern  Pacific,  a  broad  plateau  connects 
the  coast  of  South  America  and  the  Tuamotu  Islands  in  the  mid- 
Pacific,  and  in  the  Indian  Ocean  a  long  ridge  runs  from  India  to 
Antarctica,  for  most  of  its  length  broader  and  deeper  than  the 
Atlantic  Ridge. 

One  of  the  most  fascinating  fields  for  speculation  is  the  age  of 
the  submarine  mountains  compared  with  that  of  past  and  pres¬ 
ent  mountains  of  the  continents.  Looking  back  over  the  past  ages 
of  geologic  time  (page  10),  we  realize  that  mountains  have  been 
thrust  up  on  the  continents,  to  the  accompaniment  of  volcanic 
outpourings  and  violent  tremblings  of  the  earth,  only  to  crumble 
and  wear  away  under  the  attacks  of  rain  and  frost  and  flood.

Mother  Sea 


What  of  the  sea's  mountains?  Were  they  formed  in  the  same 
way  and  do  they,  too,  begin  to  die  as  soon  as  they  are  bom? 

There  are  indications  that  the  earth’s  crust  is  no  more  stable 
under  sea  than  on  land.  Quite  a  fair  proportion  of  the  world’s 
earthquakes  are  traced  through  seismographs  to  sources  under 
the  oceans,  and,  as  we  shall  see  later,  there  are  probably  as  many 
active  volcanoes  under  water  as  on  land.  Apparently  the  Atlantic 
Ridge  arose  along  a  line  of  crustal  shifting  and  rearrangement; 
although  its  volcanic  fires  seem  to  be  largely  quiescent,  it  is  at 
present  the  site  of  most  of  the  earthquakes  in  the  Atlantic  area. 
Almost  the  whole  continental  rim  of  the  Pacific  basin  is  aquiver 
with  earthquakes  and  fiery  with  volcanoes,  some  frequently  ac¬ 
tive,  some  extinct,  some  merely  sleeping  a  centuries-long  sleep 
between  periods  of  explosive  violence.  From  the  high  mountains 
that  form  an  almost  continuous  border  around  the  shores  of  the 
Pacific,  the  contours  of  the  land  slope  abruptly  down  to  very 
deep  water.  The  deep  trenches  that  lie  off  the  coast  of  South 
America,  from  Alaska  along  the  Aleutian  Islands  and  across  to 
Japan,  and  southward  off  Japan  and  the  Philippines  give  the  im¬ 
pression  of  a  landscape  in  process  of  formation,  of  a  zone  of 
earth  subject  to  great  strains. 

Yet  the  submarine  mountains  are  earth’s  nearest  approach  to 
the  ‘eternal  hills’  of  the  poets.  No  sooner  is  a  continental  moun¬ 
tain  thrust  up  than  all  the  forces  of  nature  conspire  to  level  it.  A 
mountain  of  the  deep  sea,  in  the  years  of  its  maturity,  is  beyond 
the  reach  of  the  ordinary  erosive  forces.  It  grows  up  on  the  ocean 
floor  and  may  thrust  volcanic  peaks  above  the  surface  of  the  sea. 
These  islands  are  attacked  by  the  rains,  and  in  time  the  young 
mountain  is  brought  down  within  reach  of  the  waves;  in  the 
tumult  of  the  sea’s  attack  it  sinks  again  beneath  the  surface. 
Eventually  the  peak  is  worn  down  below  the  push  and  pull  and 
drag  of  even  the  heaviest  of  storm  waves.  Here,  in  the  twilight 
of  the  sea,  in  the  calm  of  deep  water,  the  mountain  is  secure 
from  further  attack.  Here  it  is  likely  to  remain  almost  un¬ 
changed,  perhaps  throughout  the  life  of  the  earth. 

Because  of  this  virtual  immortality,  the  oldest  oceanic  moun-

tains  must  be  infinitely  older  than  any  of  the  ranges  left  on  land. 
Professor  Hess,  who  discovered  the  sea  mounts  of  the  central 
Pacific,  suggested  that  these  'drowned  ancient  islands’  may  have 
been  formed  before  the  Cambrian  period,  or  somewhere  between 
500  million  and  1  billion  years  ago.  This  would  make  them  per¬ 
haps  of  an  age  with  the  continental  mountains  of  the  Lauren- 
tian  upheaval.  But  the  sea  mounts  have  changed  little  if  at  all, 
comparing  in  elevation  with  modern  terrestrial  peaks  like  the 
Jungfrau,  Mt.  Etna,  or  Mt.  Hood;  while  of  the  mountains  of  the 
Laurentian  period  scarcely  a  trace  remains.  The  Pacific  sea 
mounts,  according  to  this  theory,  must  have  been  of  substantial 
age  when  the  Appalachians  were  thrust  up,  200  million  years 
ago;  they  stood  almost  unchanged  while  the  Appalachians  wore 
down  to  mere  wrinkles  on  the  earth’s  face.  The  sea  mounts  were 
old,  60  million  years  ago,  when  the  Alps  and  the  Himalayas,  the 
Rockies  and  the  Andes,  rose  to  their  majestic  heights.  Yet  it  is 
probable  that  they  will  be  standing  unchanged  in  the  deep  sea 
when  these,  too,  shall  have  crumbled  away  to  dust. 

As  the  hidden  lands  beneath  the  sea  become  better  known, 
there  recurs  again  and  again  the  query:  can  the  submerged 
masses  of  the  undersea  mountains  be  linked  with  the  famed  'lost 
continents’?  Shadowy  and  insubstantial  as  are  the  accounts  of  all 
such  legendary  lands— the  fabled  Lemuria  of  the  Indian  Ocean, 
St.  Brendan’s  Island,  the  lost  Atlantis— they  persistently  recur 
like  some  deeply  rooted  racial  memory  in  the  folklore  of  many 
parts  of  the  world. 

Best  known  is  Atlantis,  which  according  to  Plato’s  account  was 
a  large  island  or  continent  beyond  the  Pillars  of  Hercules.  At¬ 
lantis  was  the  home  of  a  warlike  people  ruled  by  powerful  kings 
who  made  frequent  attacks  upon  the  mainlands  of  Africa  and 
Europe,  brought  much  of  Libya  under  their  power,  roamed  the 
Mediterranean  coast  of  Europe,  and  finally  attacked  Athens. 
However,  'with  great  earthquakes  and  inundations,  in  a  single 
day  and  one  fatal  night,  all  who  had  been  warriors  [against 
Greece]  were  swallowed  up.  The  Island  of  Atlantis  disappeared 
beneath  the  sea.  Since  that  time  the  sea  in  these  quarters  has  be- 


68  Mother  Sea 

come  unnavigable;  vessels  cannot  pass  there  because  of  the  sands 
which  extend  over  the  site  of  the  buried  isle/ 

The  Atlantis  legend  has  lived  on  through  the  centuries.  As 
men  became  bold  enough  to  sail  out  on  the  Atlantic,  to  cross  it, 
and  later  to  investigate  its  depths,  they  speculated  about  the 
location  of  the  lost  land.  Various  Atlantic  islands  have  been 
said  to  be  the  remains  of  a  land  mass  once  more  extensive.  The 
lonely  wave-washed  Rocks  of  St.  Paul,  perhaps  more  often  than 
any  other,  have  been  identified  as  the  remains  of  Atlantis.  Dur¬ 
ing  the  past  century,  as  the  extent  of  the  Atlantic  Ridge  became 
better  known,  speculations  were  often  centered  upon  this  great 
mass,  far  below  the  surface  of  the  ocean. 

Unfortunately  for  these  picturesque  imaginings,  if  the  Ridge 
was  ever  exposed,  it  must  have  been  at  a  time  long  before  there 
were  men  to  populate  such  an  Atlantis.  Some  of  the  cores  taken 
from  the  Ridge  show  a  continuous  series  of  sediments  typical  of 
open  oceans,  far  from  land,  running  back  to  a  period  some  60 
million  years  ago.  And  man,  even  the  most  primitive  type,  has 
appeared  only  within  the  past  million  years  or  so. 

Like  other  legends  deeply  rooted  in  folklore,  the  Atlantis  story 
may  have  in  it  an  element  of  truth.  In  the  shadowy  beginnings  of 
human  life  on  earth,  primitive  men  here  and  there  must  have 
had  knowledge  of  the  sinking  of  an  island  or  a  peninsula,  perhaps 
not  with  the  dramatic  suddenness  attributed  to  Atlantis,  but  well 
within  the  time  one  man  could  observe.  The  witnesses  of  such  a 
happening  would  have  described  it  to  their  neighbors  and  chil¬ 
dren,  and  so  the  legend  of  a  sinking  continent  might  have  been 
born. 

Such  a  lost  land  lies  today  beneath  the  waters  of  the  North 
Sea.  Only  a  few  scores  of  thousands  of  years  ago,  the  Dogger 
Bank  was  dry  land,  but  now  the  fishermen  drag  their  nets  over 
this  famed  fishing  ground,  catching  cod  and  hake  and  flounders 
among  its  drowned  tree  trunks. 

During  the  Pleistocene,  when  immense  quantities  of  water 
were  withdrawn  from  the  ocean  and  locked  up  in  the  glaciers, 
the  floor  of  the  North  Sea  emerged  and  for  a  time  became  land. 
It  was  a  low,  wet  land,  covered  with  peat  bogs;  then  little  by 


Hidden  Lands 


69 

little  the  forests  from  the  neighboring  high  lands  must  have 
moved  in,  for  there  were  willows  and  birches  growing  among 
the  mosses  and  ferns.  Animals  moved  down  from  the  mainland 
and  became  established  on  this  land  recently  won  from  the  sea. 
There  were  bears  and  wolves  and  hyenas,  the  wild  ox,  the  bison, 
the  woolly  rhinoceros,  and  the  mammoth.  Primitive  men  moved 
through  the  forests,  carrying  crude  stone  instruments;  they 
stalked  deer  and  other  game  and  with  their  flints  grubbed  up  the 
roots  of  the  damp  forest. 

Then  as  the  glaciers  began  to  retreat  and  floods  from  the  melt¬ 
ing  ice  poured  into  the  sea  and  raised  its  level,  this  land  became 
an  island.  Probably  the  men  escaped  to  the  mainland  before  the 
intervening  channel  had  become  too  wide,  leaving  their  stone 
implements  behind.  But  most  of  the  animals  remained,  perforce, 
and  little  by  little  their  island  shrank,  and  food  became  more  and 
more  scarce,  but  there  was  no  escape.  Finally  the  sea  covered  the 
island,  claiming  the  land  and  all  its  life. 

As  for  the  men  who  escaped,  perhaps  in  their  primitive  way 
they  communicated  this  story  to  other  men,  who  passed  it  down 
to  others  through  the  ages,  until  it  became  fixed  in  the  memory 
of  the  race. 

None  of  these  facts  were  part  of  recorded  history  until,  a  gen¬ 
eration  ago,  European  fishermen  moved  out  into  the  middle  of 
the  North  Sea  and  began  to  trawl  on  the  Dogger.  They  soon 
made  out  the  contours  of  an  irregular  plateau  nearly  as  large  as 
Denmark,  lying  about  60  feet  under  water,  but  sloping  off 
abruptly  at  its  edges  into  much  deeper  water.  Their  trawls  im¬ 
mediately  began  to  bring  up  a  great  many  things  not  found  on 
any  ordinary  fishing  bank.  There  were  loose  masses  of  peat, 
which  the  fishermen  christened  ‘moorlog.’  There  were  many 
bones,  and,  although  the  fishermen  could  not  identify  them,  they 
seemed  to  belong  to  large  land  mammals.  All  of  these  objects 
damaged  the  nets  and  hindered  fishing,  so  whenever  possible  the 
fishermen  dragged  them  off  the  bank  and  sent  them  tumbling 
into  deep  water.  But  they  brought  back  some  of  the  bones,  some 
of  the  moorlog  and  fragments  of  trees,  and  the  crude  stone  im¬ 
plements;  these  specimens  were  turned  over  to  scientists  to  iden-

tify.  In  this  strange  debris  of  the  fishing  nets  the  scientists 
recognized  a  whole  Pleistocene  fauna  and  flora,  and  the  artifacts 
of  Stone  Age  man.  And  remembering  how  once  the  North  Sea 
had  been  dry  land,  they  reconstructed  the  story  of  Dogger  Bank, 
the  lost  island. 


The  Long  Snowfall 


A  DEEP  AND  TREMULOUS  EARTH-POETRY. 

— Llewelyn  Powys 


F 

il— VERY  part  of  earth  or  air  or  sea  has  an  atmosphere  pecul¬ 
iarly  its  own,  a  quality  or  characteristic  that  sets  it  apart  from  all 
others.  When  I  think  of  the  floor  of  the  deep  sea,  the  single, 
overwhelming  fact  that  possesses  my  imagination  is  the  accumu¬ 
lation  of  sediments.  I  see  always  the  steady,  unremitting,  down¬ 
ward  drift  of  materials  from  above,  flake  upon  flake,  layer  upon 
layer— a  drift  that  has  continued  for  hundreds  of  millions  of 
years,  that  will  go  on  as  long  as  there  are  seas  and  continents. 

For  the  sediments  are  the  materials  of  the  most  stupendous 
‘snowfall’  the  earth  has  ever  seen.  It  began  when  the  first  rains 
fell  on  the  barren  rocks  and  set  in  motion  the  forces  of  erosion. 
It  was  accelerated  when  living  creatures  developed  in  the  sur¬ 
face  waters  and  the  discarded  little  shells  of  lime  or  silica  that 
had  encased  them  in  life  began  to  drift  downward  to  the  bottom. 
Silently,  endlessly,  with  the  deliberation  of  earth  processes  that 
can  afford  to  be  slow  because  they  have  so  much  time  for  com¬ 
pletion,  the  accumulation  of  the  sediments  has  proceeded.  So 
little  in  a  year,  or  in  a  human  lifetime,  but  so  enormous  an 
amount  in  the  life  of  earth  and  sea.

The  rains,  the  eroding  away  of  the  earth,  the  rush  of  sediment¬ 
laden  waters  have  continued,  with  varying  pulse  and  tempo, 
throughout  all  of  geologic  time.  In  addition  to  the  silt  load  of 
every  river  that  finds  its  way  to  the  sea,  there  are  other  materials 
that  compose  the  sediments.  Volcanic  dust,  blown  perhaps  half 
way  around  the  earth  in  the  upper  atmosphere,  comes  eventuallv 
to  rest  on  the  ocean,  drifts  in  the  currents,  becomes  waterlogged, 
and  sinks.  Sands  from  coastal  deserts  are  carried  seaward  on  off¬ 
shore  winds,  fall  to  the  sea,  and  sink.  Gravel,  pebbles,  small 
boulders,  and  shells  are  carried  by  icebergs  and  drift  ice,  to  be 
released  to  the  water  when  the  ice  melts.  Fragments  of  iron, 
nickel,  and  other  meteoric  debris  that  enter  the  earth's  atmos¬ 
phere  over  the  sea— these,  too,  become  flakes  of  the  great  snow¬ 
fall.  But  most  widely  distributed  of  all  are  the  billions  upon 
billions  of  tiny  shells  and  skeletons,  the  limy  or  silicious  remains 
of  all  the  minute  creatures  that  once  lived  in  the  upper  waters. 

The  sediments  are  a  sort  of  epic  poem  of  the  earth.  When  we 
are  wise  enough,  perhaps  we  can  read  in  them  all  of  past  history. 
For  all  is  written  here.  In  the  nature  of  the  materials  that  com¬ 
pose  them  and  in  the  arrangement  of  their  successive  layers  the 
sediments  reflect  all  that  has  happened  in  the  waters  above  them 
and  on  the  surrounding  lands.  The  dramatic  and  the  catastrophic 
in  earth  history  have  left  their  trace  in  the  sediments— the  out¬ 
pourings  of  volcanoes,  the  advance  and  retreat  of  the  ice,  the 
searing  aridity  of  desert  lands,  the  sweeping  destruction  of  floods. 

The  book  of  the  sediments  has  been  opened  only  within  the 
lifetime  of  the  present  generation  of  scientists,  with  the  most  ex¬ 
citing  progress  in  collecting  and  deciphering  samples  made  since 
1945.  Early  oceanographers  could  scrape  up  surface  layers  of 
sediment  from  the  sea  bottom  with  dredges.  But  what  was 
needed  was  an  instrument,  operated  on  the  principle  of  an  apple 
corer,  that  could  be  driven  vertically  into  the  bottom  to  remove 
a  long  sample  or  ‘core'  in  which  the  order  of  the  different  layers 
was  undisturbed.  Such  an  instrument  was  invented  by  Dr.  C.  S. 
Piggot  in  1935,  and  with  the  aid  of  this  'gun'  he  obtained  a  series 
of  cores  across  the  deep  Atlantic  from  Newfoundland  to  Ireland. 
These  cores  averaged  about  10  feet  long.  A  piston  core  sampler. 


The  Long  Snowfall

developed  by  the  Swedish  oceanographer  Kullenberg  about  10 
years  later,  now  takes  undisturbed  cores  70  feet  long.  The  rate 
of  sedimentation  in  the  different  parts  of  the  ocean  is  not  defi¬ 
nitely  known,  but  it  is  very  slow;  certainly  such  a  sample  repre¬ 
sents  millions  of  years  of  geologic  history. 

Another  ingenious  method  for  studying  the  sediments  has 
been  used  by  Professor  W.  Maurice  Ewing  of  Columbia  Univer¬ 
sity  and  the  Woods  Hole  Oceanographic  Institution.  Professor 
Ewing  found  that  he  could  measure  the  thickness  of  the  carpet¬ 
ing  layer  of  sediments  that  overlies  the  rock  of  the  ocean  floor 
by  exploding  depth  charges  and  recording  their  echoes;  one  echo 
is  received  from  the  top  of  the  sediment  layer  (the  apparent 
bottom  of  the  sea),  another  from  the  'bottom  below  the  bottom' 
or  the  true  rock  floor.  The  carrying  and  use  of  explosives  at  sea 
is  hazardous  and  cannot  be  attempted  by  all  vessels,  but  this 
method  was  used  by  the  Swedish  Albatross  as  well  as  by  the 
Atlantis  in  its  exploration  of  the  Atlantic  Ridge.  Ewing  on  the 
Atlantis  also  used  a  seismic  refraction  technique  by  which  sound 
waves  are  made  to  travel  horizontally  through  the  rock  layers  of 
the  ocean  floor,  providing  information  about  the  nature  of  the 
rock. 

Before  these  techniques  were  developed,  we  could  only  guess 
at  the  thickness  of  the  sediment  blanket  over  the  floor  of  the  sea. 
We  might  have  expected  the  amount  to  be  vast,  if  we  thought 
back  through  the  ages  of  gentle,  unending  fall— one  sand  grain 
at  a  time,  one  fragile  shell  after  another,  here  a  shark's  tooth, 
there  a  meteorite  fragment — but  the  whole  continuing  persist¬ 
ently,  relentlessly,  endlessly.  It  is,  of  course,  a  process  similar  to 
that  which  has  built  up  the  layers  of  rock  that  help  to  make  our 
mountains,  for  they,  too,  were  once  soft  sediments  under  the 
shallow  seas  that  have  overflowed  the  continents  from  time  to 
time.  The  sediments  eventually  became  consolidated  and  ce¬ 
mented  and,  as  the  seas  retreated  again,  gave  the  continents 
their  thick,  covering  layers  of  sedimentary  rocks— layers  which 
we  can  see  uplifted,  tilted,  compressed,  and  broken  by  the  vast 
earth  movements.  And  we  know  that  in  places  the  sedimentary 
rocks  are  many  thousands  of  feet  thick.  Yet  most  people  felt  a 


74 


Mother  Sea 

shock  of  surprise  and  wonder  when  Hans  Pettersson,  leader  of 
the  Swedish  Deep  Sea  Expedition,  announced  that  the  Albatross 
measurements  taken  in  the  open  Atlantic  basin  showed  sediment 
layers  as  much  as  12,000  feet  thick. 

If  more  than  two  miles  of  sediments  have  been  deposited  on 
the  floor  of  the  Atlantic,  an  interesting  question  arises:  has  the 
rocky  floor  sagged  a  corresponding  distance  under  the  terrific 
weight  of  the  sediments?  Geologists  hold  conflicting  opinions. 
The  recently  discovered  Pacific  sea  mounts  may  offer  one  piece 
of  evidence  that  it  has.  If  they  are,  as  their  discoverer  called 
them,  ‘drowned  ancient  islands,’  then  they  may  have  reached 
their  present  stand  a  mile  or  so  below  sea  level  through  the  sink¬ 
ing  of  the  ocean  floor.  Hess  believed  the  islands  had  been  formed 
so  long  ago  that  coral  animals  had  not  yet  evolved;  otherwise  the 
corals  would  presumably  have  settled  on  the  flat,  planed  surfaces 
of  the  sea  mounts  and  built  them  up  as  fast  as  their  bases  sank. 
In  any  event,  it  is  hard  to  see  how  they  could  have  been  worn 
down  so  far  below  wave  base’  unless  the  crust  of  the  earth 
sagged  under  its  load. 

One  thing  seems  probable— the  sediments  have  been  unevenly 
distributed  both  in  place  and  time.  In  contrast  to  the  12,000-foot 
thickness  found  in  parts  of  the  Atlantic,  the  Swedish  oceanogra¬ 
phers  never  found  sediments  thicker  than  1000  feet  in  the  Pacific 
or  in  the  Indian  Ocean.  Perhaps  a  deep  layer  of  lava,  from  an¬ 
cient  submarine  eruptions  on  a  stupendous  scale,  underlies  the 
upper  layers  of  the  sediments  in  these  places  and  intercepts  the 
sound  waves. 

Interesting  variations  in  the  thickness  of  the  sediment  layer 
of  the  Atlantic  Ridge  and  the  approaches  to  the  Ridge  from  the 
American  side  were  reported  by  Ewing.  As  the  bottom  contours 
became  less  even  and  began  to  slope  up  into  the  foothills  of  the 
Ridge,  the  sediments  thickened,  as  though  piling  up  into  mam¬ 
moth  drifts  1000  to  2000  feet  deep  against  the  slopes  of  the  hills. 
Farther  up  in  the  mountains  of  the  Ridge,  where  there  are  many 
level  terraces  from  a  few  to  a  score  of  miles  wide,  the  sediments 
were  even  deeper,  measuring  up  to  3000  feet.  But  along  the  back- 


The  Long  Snowfall 


75 

bone  of  the  Ridge,  on  the  steep  slopes  and  peaks  and  pinnacles, 
the  bare  rock  emerged,  swept  clean  of  sediments.11 

Reflecting  on  these  differences  in  thickness  and  distribution, 
our  minds  return  inevitably  to  the  simile  of  the  long  snowfall. 
We  may  think  of  the  abyssal  snowstorm  in  terms  of  a  bleak  and 
blizzard-ridden  arctic  tundra.  Long  days  of  storm  visit  this  place, 
when  driving  snow  fills  the  air;  then  a  lull  comes  in  the  blizzard' 
and  the  snowfall  is  light.  In  the  snowfall  of  the  sediments,  also,' 
there  is  an  alternation  of  light  and  heavy  falls.  The  heavy  falls' 
correspond  to  the  periods  of  mountain  building  on  the  conti¬ 
nents,  when  the  lands  are  lifted  high  and  the  rain  rushes  down 
their  slopes,  carrying  mud  and  rock  fragments  to  the  sea;  the 
light  falls  mark  the  lulls  between  the  mountain-building  periods, 
when  the  continents  are  flat  and  erosion  is  slowed.  And  again,  on 
our  imaginary  tundra,  the  winds  blow  the  snow  into  deep  drifts, 
filling  in  all  the  valleys  between  the  ridges,  piling  the  snow  up 
and  up  until  the  contours  of  the  land  are  obliterated,  but  scour¬ 
ing  the  ridges  clear.  In  the  drifting  sediments  on  the  floor  of  the 
ocean  we  see  the  work  of  the  winds/  which  may  be  the  deep 
ocean  currents,  distributing  the  sediments  according  to  laws  of 
their  own,  not  as  yet  grasped  by  human  minds. 

We  have  known  the  general  pattern  of  the  sediment  carpet, 
however,  for  a  good  many  years.  Around  the  foundations  of  the 
continents,  in  the  deep  waters  off  the  borders  of  the  continental 
slopes,  are  the  muds  of  terrestrial  origin.  There  are  muds  of 
many  colors— blue,  green,  red,  black,  and  white— apparently  vary¬ 
ing  with  climatic  changes  as  well  as  with  the  dominant  soils  and 
rocks  of  the  lands  of  their  origin.  Farther  at  sea  are  the  oozes  of 
predominantly  marine  origin— the  remains  of  the  trillions  of  tiny 
sea  creatures.  Over  great  areas  of  the  temperate  oceans  the  sea 
floor  is  largely  covered  with  the  remains  of  unicellular  creatures 
known  as  foraminifera,  of  which  the  most  abundant  genus  is 
Globigerina.  The  shells  of  Globigerina  may  be  recognized  in 
very  ancient  sediments  as  well  as  in  modern  ones,  but  over  the 
ages  the  species  have  varied.  Knowing  this,  we  can  date  approxi¬ 
mately  the  deposits  in  which  they  occur.  But  always  they  have 


Mother  Sea 


76 

been  simple  animals,  living  in  an  intricately  sculptured  shell  of 
carbonate  of  lime,  the  whole  so  small  you  would  need  a  micro¬ 
scope  to  see  its  details.  After  the  fashion  of  unicellular  beings, 
the  individual  Globigerina  normally  did  not  die,  but  by  the  divi¬ 
sion  of  its  substance  became  two.  At  each  division,  the  old  shell 
was  abandoned,  and  two  new  ones  were  formed.  In  warm,  lime- 
rich  seas  these  tiny  creatures  have  always  multiplied  prodigiouslv, 
and  so,  although  each  is  so  minute,  their  innumerable  shells  blan¬ 
ket  millions  of  square  miles  of  ocean  bottom,  and  to  a  depth  of 
thousands  of  feet. 

In  the  great  depths  of  the  ocean,  however,  the  immense  pres¬ 
sures  and  the  high  carbon-dioxide  content  of  deep  water  dissolve 
much  of  the  lime  long  before  it  reaches  the  bottom  and  return 
it  to  the  great  chemical  reservoir  of  the  sea.  Silica  is  more  resist¬ 
ant  to  solution.  It  is  one  of  the  curious  paradoxes  of  the  ocean 
that  the  bulk  of  the  organic  remains  that  reach  the  great  depths 
intact  belong  to  unicellular  creatures  seemingly  of  the  most  deli¬ 
cate  construction.  The  radiolarians  remind  us  irresistibly  of  snow 
flakes,  as  infinitely  varied  in  pattern,  as  lacy,  and  as  intricately 
made.  Yet  because  their  shells  are  fashioned  of  silica  instead  of 
carbonate  of  lime,  they  can  descend  unchanged  into  the  abyssal 
depths.  So  there  are  broad  bands  of  radiolarian  ooze  in  the  deep 
tropical  waters  of  the  North  Pacific,  underlying  the  surface  zones 
where  the  living  radiolarians  occur  most  numerously. 

Two  other  kinds  of  organic  sediments  are  named  for  the  crea¬ 
tures  whose  remains  compose  them.  Diatoms,  the  microscopic 
plant  life  of  the  sea,  flourish  most  abundantly  in  cold  waters. 
There  is  a  broad  belt  of  diatom  ooze  on  the  floor  of  the  Antarctic 
Ocean,  outside  the  zone  of  glacial  debris  dropped  by  the  ice  pack. 
There  is  another  across  the  North  Pacific,  along  the  chain  of 
great  deeps  that  run  from  Alaska  to  Japan.  Both  are  zones  where 
nutrient-laden  water  wells  up  from  the  depths,  sustaining  a  rich 
growth  of  plants.  The  diatoms,  like  the  radiolarians  are  encased 
in  silicious  coverings— small,  boxlike  cases  of  varied  shape  and 
meticulously  etched  design. 

Then,  in  relatively  shallow  parts  of  the  open  Atlantic,  there 
are  patches  of  ooze  composed  of  the  remains  of  delicate  swim- 


The  Long  Snowfall 


77 

ming  snails,  called  pteropods.  These  winged  mollusks,  possessing 
transparent  shells  of  great  beauty,  are  here  and  there  incredibly 
abundant.  Pteropod  ooze  is  the  characteristic  bottom  deposit  in 
the  vicinity  of  Bermuda,  and  a  large  patch  occurs  in  the  South 
Atlantic. 

Mysterious  and  eerie  are  the  immense  areas,  especially  in  the 
North  Pacific,  carpeted  with  a  soft,  red  sediment  in  which  there 
are  no  organic  remains  except  sharks’  teeth  and  the  ear  bones  of 
whales.  This  red  clay  occurs  at  great  depths.  Perhaps  all  the 
materials  of  the  other  sediments  are  dissolved  before  they  can 
reach  this  zone  of  immense  pressures  and  glacial  cold. 

The  reading  of  the  story  contained  in  the  sediments  has  only 
begun.  When  more  cores  are  collected  and  examined  we  shall 
certainly  decipher  many  exciting  chapters.  Geologists  have 
pointed  out  that  a  series  of  cores  from  the  Mediterranean  might 
settle  several  controversial  problems  concerning  the  history  of 
the  ocean  and  of  the  lands  around  the  Mediterranean  basin.  For 
example,  somewhere  in  the  layers  of  sediment  under  this  sea 
there  must  be  evidence,  in  a  sharply  defined  layer  of  sand,  of  the 
time  when  the  deserts  of  the  Sahara  were  formed  and  the  hot, 
dry  winds  began  to  skim  off  the  shifting  surface  layers  and  carry 
them  seaward.  Long  cores  recently  obtained  in  the  western 
Mediterranean  off  Algeria  have  given  a  record  of  volcanic  activity 
extending  back  through  thousands  of  years,  and  including  great 
prehistoric  eruptions  of  which  we  know  nothing. 

The  Atlantic  cores  taken  more  than  a  decade  ago  by  Piggot 
from  the  cable  ship  Lord  Kelvin  have  been  thoroughly  studied  by 
geologists.  From  their  analysis  it  is  possible  to  look  back  into  the 
past  10,000  years  or  so  and  to  sense  the  pulse  of  the  earth’s  cli¬ 
matic  rhythms;  for  the  cores  were  composed  of  layers  of  cold- 
water  Globigerina  faunas  (and  hence  glacial  stage  sediments), 
alternating  with  Globigerina  ooze  characteristic  of  warmer  waters. 
From  the  clues  furnished  by  these  cores  we  can  visualize  inter¬ 
glacial  stages  when  there  were  periods  of  mild  climates,  with 
warm  water  overlying  the  sea  bottom  and  warmth-loving  crea¬ 
tures  living  in  the  ocean.  Between  these  periods  the  sea  grew 
chill.  Clouds  gathered,  the  snows  fell,  and  on  the  North  Ameri- 


Mother  Sea 


78 

can  continent  the  great  ice  sheets  grew  and  the  ice  mountains 
moved  out  to  the  coast.  The  glaciers  reached  the  sea  along  a  wide 
front;  there  they  produced  icebergs  by  the  thousand.  The  slow- 
moving,  majestic  processions  of  the  bergs  passed  out  to  sea,  and 
because  of  the  coldness  of  much  of  the  earth  they  penetrated 
farther  south  than  any  but  stray  bergs  do  today.  When  finally 
they  melted,  they  relinquished  their  loads  of  silt  and  sand  and 
gravel  and  rock  fragments  that  had  become  frozen  into  their 
under  surfaces  as  they  made  their  grinding  way  over  the  land. 
And  so  a  layer  of  glacial  sediment  came  to  overlie  the  normal 
Globigerina  ooze,  and  the  record  of  an  Ice  Age  was  inscribed. 

Then  the  sea  grew  warmer  again,  the  glaciers  melted  and  re¬ 
treated,  and  once  more  the  warmer-water  species  of  Globigerina 
lived  in  the  sea— lived  and  died  and  drifted  down  to  build  an¬ 
other  layer  of  Globigerina  ooze,  this  time  over  the  clays  and 
gravels  from  the  glaciers.  And  the  record  of  warmth  and  mildness 
was  again  written  in  the  sediments.  From  the  Piggot  cores  it  has 
been  possible  to  reconstruct  four  different  periods  of  the  advance 
of  the  ice,  separated  by  periods  of  warm  climate. 

It  is  interesting  to  think  that  even  now,  in  our  own  lifetime, 
the  flakes  of  a  new  snow  storm  are  falling,  falling,  one  by  one, 
out  there  on  the  ocean  floor.  The  billions  of  Globigerina  are 
drifting  down,  writing  their  unequivocal  record  that  this,  out 
present  world,  is  on  the  whole  a  world  of  mild  and  temperate 
climate.  Who  will  read  their  record,  ten  thousand  years  from 
now? 


The  Birth  oi  an  Island 


MANY  A  GREEN  ISLE  NEEDS  MUST  BE 
IN  THE  DEEP,  WIDE  SEA  .  .  . 

— Shelley 


ILLIONS  of  years  ago,  a  volcano  built  a  mountain  on 
the  floor  of  the  Atlantic.  In  eruption  after  eruption,  it  pushed 
up  a  great  pile  of  volcanic  rock,  until  it  had  accumulated  a  mass 
a  hundred  miles  across  at  its  base,  reaching  upward  toward  the 
surface  of  the  sea.  Finally  its  cone  emerged  as  an  island  with  an 
area  of  about  200  square  miles.  Thousands  of  years  passed,  and 
thousands  of  thousands.  Eventually  the  waves  of  the  Atlantic 
cut  down  the  cone  and  reduced  it  to  a  shoal— all  of  it,  that  is, 
but  a  small  fragment  which  remained  above  water.  This  frag¬ 
ment  we  know  as  Bermuda. 

With  variations,  the  life  story  of  Bermuda  has  been  repeated 
by  almost  every  one  of  the  islands  that  interrupt  the  watery  ex¬ 
panses  of  the  oceans  far  from  land.  For  these  isolated  islands  in 
the  sea  are  fundamentally  different  from  the  continents.  The 
major  land  masses  and  the  ocean  basins  are  today  much  as  they 
have  been  throughout  the  greater  part  of  geologic  time.  But 
islands  are  ephemeral,  created  today,  destroyed  tomorrow.  With 
few  exceptions,  they  are  the  result  of  the  violent,  explosive,

Mother  Sea 


earth-shaking  eruptions  of  submarine  volcanoes,  working  perhaps 
for  millions  of  years  to  achieve  their  end.  It  is  one  of  the  para¬ 
doxes  in  the  ways  of  earth  and  sea  that  a  process  seemingly  so 
destructive,  so  catastrophic  in  nature,  can  result  in  an  act  of 
creation. 

Islands  have  always  fascinated  the  human  mind.  Perhaps  it  is 
the  instinctive  response  of  man,  the  land  animal,  welcoming  a 
brief  intrusion  of  earth  in  the  vast,  overwhelming  expanse  of  sea. 
Here  in  a  great  ocean  basin,  a  thousand  miles  from  the  nearest 
continent,  with  miles  of  water  under  our  vessel,  we  come  upon 
an  island.  Our  imaginations  can  follow  its  slopes  down  through 
darkening  waters  to  where  it  rests  on  the  sea  floor.  We  wonder 
why  and  how  it  arose  here  in  the  midst  of  the  ocean. 

The  birth  of  a  volcanic  island  is  an  event  marked  by  pro¬ 
longed  and  violent  travail:  the  forces  of  the  earth  striving  to 
create,  and  all  the  forces  of  the  sea  opposing.  The  sea  floor, 
where  an  island  begins,  is  probably  nowhere  more  than  about 
fifty  miles  thick— a  thin  covering  over  the  vast  bulk  of  the  earth. 
In  it  are  deep  cracks  and  fissures,  the  results  of  unequal  cooling 
and  shrinkage  in  past  ages.  Along  such  lines  of  weakness  the 
molten  lava  from  the  earth’s  interior  presses  up  and  finally  bursts 
forth  into  the  sea.  But  a  submarine  volcano  is  different  from  a 
terrestrial  eruption,  where  the  lava,  molten  rocks,  gases,  and 
other  ejecta  are  hurled  into  the  air  through  an  open  crater.  Here 
on  the  bottom  of  the  ocean  the  volcano  has  resisting  it  all  the 
weight  of  the  ocean  water  above  it.  Despite  the  immense  pres¬ 
sure  of,  it  may  be,  two  or  three  miles  of  sea  water,  the  new  vol¬ 
canic  cone  builds  upward  toward  the  surface,  in  flow  after  flow 
of  lava.  Once  within  reach  of  the  waves,  its  soft  ash  and  tuff  are 
violently  attacked,  and  for  a  long  period  the  potential  island  may 
remain  a  shoal,  unable  to  emerge.  But,  eventually,  in  new  erup¬ 
tions,  the  cone  is  pushed  up  into  the  air  and  a  rampart  against 
the  attacks  of  the  waves  is  built  of  hardened  lava. 

Navigators’  charts  are  marked  with  numerous,  recently  discov¬ 
ered  submarine  mountains.  Many  of  these  are  the  submerged 
remnants  of  the  islands  of  a  geologic  yesterday.  The  same  charts 
show  islands  that  emerged  from  the  sea  at  least  fifty  million  years 


The  Birth  of  an  Island

ago,  and  others  that  arose  within  our  own  memory.  Among  the 
undersea  mountains  marked  on  the  charts  may  be  the  islands  of 
tomorrow,  which  at  this  moment  are  forming,  unseen,  on  the 
floor  of  the  ocean  and  are  growing  upward  toward  its  surface. 

For  the  sea  is  by  no  means  done  with  submarine  eruptions; 
they  occur  fairly  commonly,  sometimes  detected  only  by  instru¬ 
ments,  sometimes  obvious  to  the  most  casual  observer.  Ships  in 
volcanic  zones  may  suddenly  find  themselves  in  violently  dis¬ 
turbed  water.  There  are  heavy  discharges  of  steam.  The  sea  ap¬ 
pears  to  bubble  or  boil  in  a  furious  turbulence.  Fountains  spring 
from  its  surface.  Floating  up  from  the  deep,  hidden  places  of  the 
actual  eruption  come  the  bodies  of  fishes  and  other  deep-sea 
creatures,  and  quantities  of  volcanic  ash  and  pumice. 

One  of  the  youngest  of  the  large  volcanic  islands  of  the  world 
is  Ascension  in  the  South  Atlantic.  During  the  Second  World 
War  the  American  airmen  sang 

If  we  don’t  find  Ascension 
Our  wives  will  get  a  pension 

this  island  being  the  only  piece  of  dry  land  between  the  hump 
of  Brazil  and  the  bulge  of  Africa.  It  is  a  forbidding  mass  of  cin¬ 
ders,  in  which  the  vents  of  no  less  than  forty  extinct  volcanoes 
can  be  counted.  It  has  not  always  been  so  barren,  for  its  slopes 
have  yielded  the  fossil  remains  of  trees.  What  happened  to  the 
forests  no  one  knows;  the  first  men  to  explore  the  island,  about 
the  year  1 500,  found  it  treeless,  and  today  it  has  no  natural  green¬ 
ness  except  on  its  highest  peak,  known  as  Green  Mountain. 

In  modern  times  we  have  never  seen  the  birth  of  an  island  as 
large  as  Ascension.  But  now  and  then  there  is  a  report  of  a  small 
island  appearing  where  none  was  before.  Perhaps  a  month,  a 
year,  five  years  later,  the  island  has  disappeared  into  the  sea 
again.  These  are  the  little,  stillborn  islands,  doomed  to  only  a 
brief  emergence  above  the  sea. 

About  1830  such  an  island  suddenly  appeared  in  the  Mediter¬ 
ranean  between  Sicily  and  the  coast  of  Africa,  rising  from  100- 
fathom  depths  after  there  had  been  signs  of  volcanic  activity  in 
the  area.  It  was  little  more  than  a  black  cinder  pile,  perhaps  200

feet  high.  Waves,  wind,  and  rain  attacked  it.  Its  soft  and  porous 
materials  were  easily  eroded;  its  substance  was  rapidly  eaten 
away  and  it  sank  beneath  the  sea.  Now  it  is  a  shoal,  marked  on 
the  charts  as  Graham’s  Reef. 

Falcon  Island,  the  tip  of  a  volcano  projecting  above  the  Pacific 
nearly  two  thousand  miles  east  of  Australia,  suddenly  disap¬ 
peared  in  1913.  Thirteen  years  later,  after  violent  eruptions  in 
the  vicinity,  it  as  suddenly  rose  again  above  the  surface  and  re¬ 
mained  as  a  physical  bit  of  the  British  Empire  until  1949.  Then 
it  was  reported  by  the  Colonial  Under  Secretary  to  be  missing 
again. 

Almost  from  the  moment  of  its  creation,  a  volcanic  island  is 
foredoomed  to  destruction.  It  has  in  itself  the  seeds  of  its  own 
dissolution,  for  new  explosions,  or  landslides  of  the  soft  soil,  may 
violently  accelerate  its  disintegration.  Whether  the  destruction 
of  an  island  comes  quickly  or  only  after  long  ages  of  geologic 
time  may  also  depend  on  external  forces:  the  rains  that  wear 
away  the  loftiest  of  land  mountains,  the  sea,  and  even  man  him¬ 
self. 

South  Trinidad,  or  in  the  Portuguese  spelling,  ‘Ilha  Trinidade,’ 
is  an  example  of  an  island  that  has  been  sculptured  into  bizarre 
forms  through  centuries  of  weathering— an  island  in  which  the 
signs  of  dissolution  are  clearly  apparent.  This  group  of  volcanic 
peaks  lies  in  the  open  Atlantic,  about  a  thousand  miles  north¬ 
east  of  Rio  de  Janeiro.  E.  F.  Knight  wrote  in  1907  that  Trinidad 
‘is  rotten  throughout,  its  substance  has  been  disintegrated  by  vol¬ 
canic  fires  and  by  the  action  of  water,  so  that  it  is  everywhere 
tumbling  to  pieces/  During  an  interval  of  nine  years  between 
Knight’s  visits,  a  whole  mountainside  had  collapsed  in  a  great 
landslide  of  broken  rocks  and  volcanic  debris. 

Sometimes  the  disintegration  takes  abrupt  and  violent  form. 
The  greatest  explosion  of  historic  time  was  the  literal  eviscer¬ 
ation  of  the  island  of  Krakatoa.  In  1680  there  had  been  a  pre¬ 
monitory  eruption  on  this  small  island  in  Sunda  Strait,  between 
Java  and  Sumatra  in  the  Netherlands  Indies.  Two  hundred  years 
later  there  had  been  a  series  of  earthquakes.  In  the  spring  of 
1883,  smoke  and  steam  began  to  ascend  from  fissures  in  the  vol- 


The  Birth  of  an  Island

canic  cone.  The  ground  became  noticeably  warm,  and  warning 
rumblings  and  hissings  came  from  the  volcano.  Then,  on  27 
August,  Krakatoa  literally  exploded.  In  an  appalling  series  of 
eruptions,  that  lasted  two  days,  the  whole  northern  half  of  the 
cone  was  carried  away.  The  sudden  inrush  of  ocean  water  added 
the  fury  of  superheated  steam  to  the  cauldron.  When  the  in¬ 
ferno  of  white-hot  lava,  molten  rock,  steam,  and  smoke  had 
finally  subsided,  the  island  that  had  stood  1400  feet  above  the 
sea  had  become  a  cavity  a  thousand  feet  below  sea  level.  Only 
along  one  edge  of  the  former  crater  did  a  remnant  of  the  island 
remain. 

Krakatoa,  in  its  destruction,  became  known  to  the  entire 
world.  The  eruption  gave  rise  to  a  hundred-foot  wave  that  wiped 
out  villages  along  the  Strait  and  killed  people  by  tens  of  thou¬ 
sands.  The  wave  was  felt  on  the  shores  of  the  Indian  Ocean  and 
at  Cape  Horn;  rounding  the  Cape  into  the  Atlantic,  it  sped 
northward  and  retained  its  identity  even  as  far  as  the  English 
Channel.  The  sound  of  the  explosions  was  heard  in  the  Philip¬ 
pine  Islands,  in  Australia,  and  on  the  Island  of  Madagascar, 
nearly  3000  miles  away.  And  clouds  of  volcanic  dust,  the  pulver¬ 
ized  rock  that  had  been  torn  from  the  heart  of  Krakatoa,  as¬ 
cended  into  the  stratosphere  and  were  carried  around  the  globe 
to  give  rise  to  a  series  of  spectacular  sunsets  in  every  country  of 
the  world  for  nearly  a  year. 

Although  Krakatoa’s  dramatic  passing  was  the  most  violent 
eruption  that  modern  man  has  witnessed,  Krakatoa  itself  seems 
to  have  been  the  product  of  an  even  greater  one.  There  is  evi¬ 
dence  that  an  immense  volcano  once  stood  where  the  waters  of 
Sunda  Strait  now  lie.  In  some  remote  period  a  titanic  explosion 
blew  it  away,  leaving  only  its  base  represented  by  a  broken  ring 
of  islands.  The  largest  of  these  was  Krakatoa,  which,  in  its  own 
demise,  carried  away  what  was  left  of  the  original  crater  ring. 
But  in  1929  a  new  volcanic  island  arose  in  this  place— Anak 
Krakatoa,  Child  of  Krakatoa. 

Subterranean  fires  and  deep  unrest  disturb  the  whole  area  oc¬ 
cupied  by  the  Aleutians.  The  islands  themselves  are  the  peaks  of 
a  thousand-mile  chain  of  undersea  mountains,  of  which  volcanic

action  was  the  chief  architect.  The  geologic  structure  of  the  ridge 
is  little  known,  but  it  rises  abruptly  from  oceanic  depths  of  about 
a  mile  on  one  side  and  two  miles  on  the  other.  Apparently  this 
long  narrow  ridge  indicates  a  deep  fracture  of  the  earth's  crust. 
On  many  of  the  islands  volcanoes  are  now  active,  or  only  tempo¬ 
rarily  quiescent.  In  the  short  history  of  modern  navigation  in  this 
region,  it  has  often  happened  that  a  new  island  has  been  re¬ 
ported  but  perhaps  only  the  following  year  could  not  be  found. 

The  small  island  of  Bogoslof,  since  it  was  first  observed  in 
1796,  has  altered  its  shape  and  position  several  times  and  has 
even  disappeared  completely,  only  to  emerge  again.  The  original 
island  was  a  mass  of  black  rock,  sculptured  into  fantastic,  tower¬ 
like  shapes.  Explorers  and  sealers  coming  upon  it  in  the  fog  were 
reminded  of  a  castle  and  named  it  Castle  Rock.  At  the  present 
time  there  remain  only  one  or  two  pinnacles  of  the  castle,  a  long 
spit  of  black  rocks  where  sea  lions  haul  out,  and  a  cluster  of 
higher  rocks  resounding  with  the  cries  of  thousands  of  sea  birds. 
Each  time  the  parent  volcano  erupts,  as  it  has  done  at  least  half 
a  dozen  times  since  men  have  been  observing  it,  new  masses  of 
steaming  rocks  emerge  from  the  heated  waters,  some  to  reach 
heights  of  several  hundred  feet  before  they  are  destroyed  in  fresh 
explosions.  Each  new  cone  that  appears  is,  as  described  by  the 
volcanologist  Jaggar,  'the  live  crest,  equivalent  to  a  crater,  of  a 
great  submarine  heap  of  lava  six  thousand  feet  high,  piled  above 
the  floor  of  Bering  Sea  where  the  Aleutian  mountains  fall  off  to 
the  deep  sea.' 

One  of  the  few  exceptions  to  the  almost  universal  rule  that 
oceanic  islands  have  a  volcanic  origin  seems  to  be  the  remarkable 
and  fascinating  group  of  islets  known  as  the  Rocks  of  St.  Paul. 
Lying  in  the  open  Atlantic  between  Brazil  and  Africa,  St.  Paul's 
Rocks  are  an  obstruction  thrust  up  from  the  floor  of  the  ocean 
into  the  midst  of  the  racing  Equatorial  Current,  a  mass  against 
which  the  seas,  which  have  rolled  a  thousand  miles  unhindered, 
break  in  sudden  violence.  The  entire  cluster  of  rocks  covers  not 
more  than  a  quarter  of  a  mile,  running  in  a  curved  line  like  a 
horseshoe.  The  highest  rock  is  no  more  than  sixty  feet  above  the 
sea;  spray  wets  it  to  the  summit.  Abruptly  the  rocks  dip  under

water  and  slope  steeply  down  into  great  depths.  Geologists  since 
the  time  of  Darwin  have  puzzled  over  the  origin  of  these  black, 
wave- washed  islets.  Most  of  them  agree  that  they  are  composed 
of  material  like  that  of  the  sea  floor  itself.  In  some  remote  pe¬ 
riod,  inconceivable  stresses  in  the  earth's  crust  must  have  pushed 
a  solid  rock  mass  upward  more  than  two  miles. 

So  bare  and  desolate  that  not  even  a  lichen  grows  on  them,  St. 
Paul's  Rocks  would  seem  one  of  the  most  unpromising  places  in 
the  world  to  look  for  a  spider,  spinning  its  web  in  arachnidan 
hope  of  snaring  passing  insects.  Yet  Darwin  found  spiders  when 
he  visited  the  Rocks  in  1833,  and  forty  years  later  the  naturalists 
of  H.M.S.  Challenger  also  reported  them,  busy  at  their  web¬ 
spinning.  A  few  insects  are  there,  too,  some  as  parasites  on  the 
sea  birds,  three  species  of  which  nest  on  the  Rocks.  One  of  the 
insects  is  a  small  brown  moth  that  lives  on  feathers.  This  very 
nearly  completes  the  inventory  of  the  inhabitants  of  St.  Paul's 
Rocks,  except  for  the  grotesque  crabs  that  swarm  over  the  islets, 
living  chiefly  on  the  flying  fish  brought  by  the  birds  to  their 
young. 

St.  Paul's  Rocks  are  not  alone  in  having  an  extraordinary  as¬ 
sortment  of  inhabitants,  for  the  faunas  and  floras  of  oceanic 
islands  are  amazingly  different  from  those  of  the  continents.  The 
pattern  of  island  life  is  peculiar  and  significant.  Aside  from  forms 
recently  introduced  by  man,  islands  remote  from  the  continents 
are  never  inhabited  by  any  land  mammals,  except  sometimes  the 
one  mammal  that  has  learned  to  fly — the  bat.  There  are  never 
any  frogs,  salamanders,  or  other  amphibians.  Of  reptiles,  there 
may  be  a  few  snakes,  lizards,  and  turtles,  but  the  more  remote 
the  island  from  a  major  land  mass,  the  fewer  reptiles  there  are, 
and  the  really  isolated  islands  have  none.  There  are  usually  a 
few  species  of  land  birds,  some  insects,  and  some  spiders.  So 
remote  an  island  as  Tristan  da  Cunha  in  the  South  Atlantic, 
1 500  miles  from  the  nearest  continent,  has  no  land  animals  but 
these:  three  species  of  land  birds,  a  few  insects,  and  several  small 
snails. 

With  so  selective  a  list,  it  is  hard  to  see  how,  as  some  biolo¬ 
gists  believe,  the  islands  could  have  been  colonized  by  migration 


86 


Mother  Sea 


across  land  bridges,  even  if  there  were  good  evidence  for  the 
existence  of  the  bridges.  The  very  animals  missing  from  the 
islands  are  the  ones  that  would  have  had  to  come  dry-shod,  over 
the  hypothetical  bridges.  The  plants  and  animals  that  we  find  on 
oceanic  islands,  on  the  other  hand,  are  the  ones  that  could  have 
come  by  wind  or  water.  As  an  alternative,  then,  we  must  suppose 
that  the  stocking  of  the  islands  has  been  accomplished  by  the 
strangest  migration  in  earth’s  history— a  migration  that  began 
long  before  man  appeared  on  earth  and  is  still  continuing,  a 
migration  that  seems  more  like  a  series  of  cosmic  accidents  than 
an  orderly  process  of  nature. 

We  can  only  guess  how  long  after  its  emergence  from  the  sea 
an  oceanic  island  may  lie  uninhabited.  Certainly  in  its  original 
state  it  is  a  land  bare,  harsh,  and  repelling  beyond  human  ex¬ 
perience.  No  living  thing  moves  over  the  slopes  of  its  volcanic 
hills;  no  plants  cover  its  naked  lava  fields.  But  little  by  little, 
riding  on  the  winds,  drifting  on  the  currents,  or  rafting  in  on 
logs,  floating  brush,  or  trees,  the  plants  and  animals  that  are  to 
colonize  it  arrive  from  the  distant  continents. 

So  deliberate,  so  unhurried,  so  inexorable  are  the  ways  of  na¬ 
ture  that  the  stocking  of  an  island  may  require  thousands  or 
millions  of  years.  It  may  be  that  no  more  than  half  a  dozen  times 
in  all  these  eons  does  a  particular  form,  such  as  a  tortoise,  make 
a  successful  landing  upon  its  shores.  To  wonder  impatiently  why 
man  is  not  a  constant  witness  of  such  arrivals  is  to  fail  to  under¬ 
stand  the  majestic  pace  of  the  process. 

Yet  we  have  occasional  glimpses  of  the  method.  Natural  rafts 
of  uprooted  trees  and  matted  vegetation  have  frequently  been 
seen  adrift  at  sea,  more  than  a  thousand  miles  off  the  mouths  of 
such  great  tropical  rivers  as  the  Congo,  the  Ganges,  the  Amazon, 
and  the  Orinoco.  Such  rafts  could  easily  carry  an  assortment  of 
insect,  reptile,  or  mollusk  passengers.  Some  of  the  involuntary 
passengers  might  be  able  to  withstand  long  weeks  at  sea;  others 
would  die  during  the  first  stages  of  the  journey.  Probably  the 
ones  best  adapted  for  travel  by  raft  are  the  wood-boring  insects, 
which,  of  all  the  insect  tribe,  are  most  commonly  found  on 
oceanic  islands.  The  poorest  raft  travelers  must  be  the  mammals. 


The  Birth  of  an  Island

But  even  a  mammal  might  cover  short  interisland  distances.  A 
few  days  after  the  explosion  of  Krakatoa,  a  small  monkey  was 
rescued  from  some  drifting  timber  in  Sunda  Strait.  She  had  been 
terribly  burned,  but  survived  the  experience. 

No  less  than  the  water,  the  winds  and  the  air  currents  play 
their  part  in  bringing  inhabitants  to  the  islands.  The  upper  at¬ 
mosphere,  even  during  the  ages  before  man  entered  it  in  his 
machines,  was  a  place  of  congested  traffic.  Thousands  of  feet 
above  the  earth,  the  air  is  crowded  with  living  creatures,  drift- 
m&amp;&gt;  gliding,  ballooning,  or  involuntarily  swirling  along 

on  the  high  winds.  Discovery  of  this  rich  aerial  plankton  had  to 
wait  until  man  himself  had  found  means  to  make  physical  inva¬ 
sion  of  these  regions.  With  special  nets  and  traps,  scientists  have 
now  collected  from  the  upper  atmosphere  many  of  the  forms 
that  inhabit  oceanic  islands.  Spiders,  whose  almost  invariable 
presence  on  these  islands  is  a  fascinating  problem,  have  been 
captured  nearly  three  miles  above  the  earth’s  surface.  Airmen 
have  passed  through  great  numbers  of  the  white,  silken  filaments 
of  spiders’  parachutes’  at  heights  of  two  to  three  miles.  At  alti¬ 
tudes  of  6000  to  16,000  feet,  and  with  wind  velocities  reaching 
45  miles  an  hour,  many  living  insects  have  been  taken.  At  such 
heights  and  on  such  strong  winds,  they  might  well  have  been 
carried  hundreds  of  miles.  Seeds  have  been  collected  at  altitudes 
up  to  5000  feet.  Among  those  commonly  taken  are  members  of 
the  Composite  family,  especially  the  so-called  ‘thistle-down’ 
typical  of  oceanic  islands. 

An  interesting  point  about  transport  of  living  plants  and  ani¬ 
mals  by  wind  is  the  fact  that  in  the  upper  layers  of  the  earth’s 
atmosphere  the  winds  do  not  necessarily  blow  in  the  same  direc¬ 
tion  as  at  the  earth’s  surface.  The  trade  winds  are  notably  shal¬ 
low,  so  that  a  man  standing  on  the  cliffs  of  St.  Helena,  a  thou¬ 
sand  feet  above  the  sea,  is  above  the  wind,  which  blows  with 
great  force  below  him.  Once  drawn  into  the  upper  air,  insects, 
seeds,  and  the  like  can  easily  be  carried  in  a  direction  contrary 
to  that  of  the  winds  prevailing  at  island  level. 

The  wide-ranging  birds  that  visit  islands  of  the  ocean  in  migra¬ 
tion  may  also  have  a  good  deal  to  do  with  the  distribution  of 


88 


Mother  Sea 


plants,  and  perhaps  even  of  some  insects  and  minute  land  shells. 
From  a  ball  of  mud  taken  from  a  bird’s  plumage,  Charles  Darwin 
raised  eighty-two  separate  plants,  belonging  to  five  distinct 
species!  Many  plant  seeds  have  hooks  or  prickles,  ideal  for  attach¬ 
ment  to  feathers.  Such  birds  as  the  Pacific  golden  plover,  which 
annually  flies  from  the  mainland  of  Alaska  to  the  Hawaiian 
Islands  and  even  beyond,  probably  figure  in  many  riddles  of 
plant  distribution. 

The  catastrophe  of  Krakatoa  gave  naturalists  a  perfect  oppor¬ 
tunity  to  observe  the  colonization  of  an  island.  With  most  of  the 
island  itself  destroyed,  and  the  remnant  covered  with  a  deep 
layer  of  lava  and  ash  that  remained  hot  for  weeks,  Krakatoa  after 
the  explosive  eruptions  of  1883  was,  from  a  biological  standpoint, 
a  new  volcanic  island.  As  soon  as  it  was  possible  to  visit  it,  scien¬ 
tists  searched  for  signs  of  life,  although  it  was  hard  to  imagine 
how  any  living  thing  could  have  survived.  Not  a  single  plant  or 
animal  could  be  found.  It  was  not  until  nine  months  after  the 
eruption  that  the  naturalist  Cotteau  was  able  to  report:  'I  only 
discovered  one  microscopic  spider— only  one.  This  strange  pio¬ 
neer  of  the  renovation  was  busy  spinning  its  web.’  Since  there 
were  no  insects  on  the  island,  the  web-spinning  of  the  bold  little 
spider  was  presumably  in  vain,  and  except  for  a  few  blades  of 
grass,  practically  nothing  lived  on  Krakatoa  for  a  quarter  of  a 
century.  Then  the  colonists  began  to  arrive — a  few  mammals  in 
1908;  a  number  of  birds,  lizards,  and  snakes;  various  mollusks, 
insects,  and  earthworms.  Ninety  per  cent  of  Krakatoa’s  new  in¬ 
habitants,  Dutch  scientists  found,  were  forms  that  could  have 
arrived  by  air. 

Isolated  from  the  great  mass  of  life  on  the  continents,  with  no 
opportunity  for  the  crossbreeding  that  tends  to  preserve  the  aver¬ 
age  and  to  eliminate  the  new  and  unusual,  island  life  has  devel¬ 
oped  in  a  remarkable  manner.  On  these  remote  bits  of  earth, 
nature  has  excelled  in  the  creation  of  strange  and  wonderful 
forms.  As  though  to  prove  her  incredible  versatility,  almost  every 
island  has  developed  species  that  are  endemic— that  is,  they  are 
peculiar  to  it  alone  and  are  duplicated  nowhere  else  on  earth. 

It  was  from  the  pages  of  earth’s  history  written  on  the  lava 


The  Birth  of  an  Island 


89 

fields  of  the  Galapagos  that  young  Charles  Darwin  got  his  first 
inkling  of  the  great  truths  of  the  origin  of  species.  Observing  the 
strange  plants  and  animals— giant  tortoises,  black,  amazing  lizards 
that  hunted  their  food  in  the  surf,  sea  lions,  birds  in  extraordinary 
variety— Darwin  was  struck  by  their  vague  similarity  to  mainland 
species  of  South  and  Central  America,  yet  was  haunted  by  the 
differences,  differences  that  distinguish  them  not  only  from  the 
mainland  species  but  from  those  on  other  islands  of  the  archi¬ 
pelago.  Years  later  he  was  to  write  in  reminiscence:  'Both  in 
space  and  time,  we  seem  to  be  brought  somewhat  near  to  that 
great  fact— that  mystery  of  mysteries— the  first  appearance  of 
new  beings  on  earth.’ 

Of  the  'new  beings’  evolved  on  islands,  some  of  the  most  strik¬ 
ing  examples  have  been  birds.  In  some  remote  age  before  there 
were  men,  a  small,  pigeonlike  bird  found  its  way  to  the  island  of 
Mauritius,  in  the  Indian  Ocean.  By  processes  of  change  at  which 
we  can  only  guess,  this  bird  lost  the  power  of  flight,  developed 
short,  stout  legs,  and  grew  larger  until  it  reached  the  size  of  a 
modern  turkey.  Such  was  the  origin  of  the  fabulous  dodo,  which 
did  not  long  survive  the  advent  of  man  on  Mauritius.  New  Zea¬ 
land  was  the  sole  home  of  the  moas.  One  species  of  these  ostrich¬ 
like  birds  stood  twelve  feet  high.  Moas  had  roamed  New  Zealand 
from  the  early  part  of  the  Tertiary;  those  that  remained  when  the 
Maoris  arrived  soon  died  out. 

Other  island  forms  besides  the  dodo  and  the  moas  have  tended 
to  become  large.  Perhaps  the  Galapagos  tortoise  became  a  giant 
after  its  arrival  on  the  islands,  although  fossil  remains  on  the  con¬ 
tinents  cast  doubt  on  this.  The  loss  of  wing  use  and  even  of  the 
wings  themselves  (the  moas  had  none)  are  common  results  of 
insular  life.  Insects  on  small,  wind-swept  islands  tend  to  lose  the 
power  of  flight — those  that  retain  it  are  in  danger  of  being  blown 
out  to  sea.  The  Galapagos  Islands  have  a  flightless  cormorant. 
There  have  been  at  least  fourteen  species  of  flightless  rails  on 
the  islands  of  the  Pacific  alone. 

One  of  the  most  interesting  and  engaging  characteristics  of 
island  species  is  their  extraordinary  tameness— a  lack  of  sophisti¬ 
cation  in  dealings  with  the  human  race,  which  even  the  bitter 


9° 


Mother  Sea 


teachings  of  experience  do  not  quickly  alter.  When  Robert  Cush¬ 
man  Murphy  visited  the  island  of  South  Trinidad  in  1913  with 
a  party  from  the  brig  Daisy ,  terns  alighted  on  the  heads  of  the 
men  in  the  whaleboat  and  peered  inquiringly  into  their  faces. 
Albatrosses  on  Laysan,  whose  habits  include  wonderful  cere¬ 
monial  dances,  allowed  naturalists  to  walk  among  their  colonies 
and  responded  with  a  grave  bow  to  similar  polite  greetings  from 
the  visitors.  When  the  British  ornithologist  David  Lack  visited 
the  Galapagos  Islands,  a  century  after  Darwin,  he  found  that  the 
hawks  allowed  themselves  to  be  touched,  and  the  flycatchers 
tried  to  remove  hair  from  the  heads  of  the  men  for  nesting  mate¬ 
rial.  'It  is  a  curious  pleasure/  he  wrote,  'to  have  the  birds  of  the 
wilderness  settling  upon  one’s  shoulders,  and  the  pleasure  could 
be  much  less  rare  were  man  less  destructive/ 

But  man,  unhappily,  has  written  one  of  his  blackest  records 
as  a  destroyer  on  the  oceanic  islands.  He  has  seldom  set  foot  on 
an  island  that  he  has  not  brought  about  disastrous  changes.  He 
has  destroyed  environments  by  cutting,  clearing,  and  burning;  he 
has  brought  with  him  as  a  chance  associate  the  nefarious  rat;  and 
almost  invariably  he  has  turned  loose  upon  the  islands  a  whole 
Noah’s  Ark  of  goats,  hogs,  cattle,  dogs,  cats,  and  other  non-native 
animals  as  well  as  plants.  Upon  species  after  species  of  island 
life,  the  black  night  of  extinction  has  fallen. 

In  all  the  world  of  living  things,  it  is  doubtful  whether  there 
is  a  more  delicately  balanced  relationship  than  that  of  island  life 
to  its  environment.  This  environment  is  a  remarkably  uniform 
one.  In  the  midst  of  a  great  ocean,  ruled  by  currents  and  winds 
that  rarely  shift  their  course,  climate  changes  little.  There  are  few 
natural  enemies,  perhaps  none  at  all.  The  harsh  struggle  for  ex¬ 
istence  that  is  the  normal  lot  of  continental  life  is  softened  on 
the  islands.  When  this  gentle  pattern  of  life  is  abruptly  changed, 
the  island  creatures  have  little  ability  to  make  the  adjustments 
necessary  for  survival. 

Ernst  Mayr  tells  of  a  steamer  wrecked  off  Lord  Howe  Island 
east  of  Australia  in  1918.  Its  rats  swam  ashore.  In  two  years  they 
had  so  nearly  exterminated  the  native  birds  that  an  islander

wrote,  'This  paradise  of  birds  has  become  a  wilderness,  and  the 
quietness  of  death  reigns  where  all  was  melody/ 

On  Tristan  da  Cunha  almost  all  of  the  unique  land  birds  that 
had  evolved  there  in  the  course  of  the  ages  were  exterminated  by- 
hogs  and  rats.  The  native  fauna  of  the  island  of  Tahiti  is  losing 
ground  against  the  horde  of  alien  species  that  man  has  intro¬ 
duced.  The  Hawaiian  Islands,  which  have  lost  their  native  plants 
and  animals  faster  than  almost  any  other  area  in  the  world,  are 
a  classic  example  of  the  results  of  interfering  with  natural  bal¬ 
ances.  Certain  relations  of  animal  to  plant,  and  of  plant  to  soil, 
had  grown  up  through  the  centuries.  When  man  came  in  and 
rudely  disturbed  this  balance,  he  set  off  a  whole  series  of  chain 
reactions. 

Vancouver  brought  cattle  and  goats  to  the  Hawaiian  Islands, 
and  the  resulting  damage  to  forests  and  other  vegetation  was 
enormous.  Many  plant  introductions  were  as  bad.  A  plant  known 
as  the  pamakani  was  brought  in  many  years  ago,  according  to 
report,  by  a  Captain  Makee  for  his  beautiful  gardens  on  the 
island  of  Maui.  The  pamakani,  which  has  light,  wind-borne 
seeds,  quickly  escaped  from  the  captain’s  gardens,  ruined  the 
pasture  lands  on  Maui,  and  proceeded  to  hop  from  island  to 
island.  The  CCC  boys  were  at  one  time  put  to  work  to  clear  it 
out  of  the  Honouliuli  Forest  Reserve,  but  as  fast  as  they  de¬ 
stroyed  it,  the  seeds  of  new  plants  arrived  on  the  wind.  Lantana 
was  another  plant  brought  in  as  an  ornamental  species.  Now  it 
covers  thousands  of  acres  with  a  thorny,  scrambling  growth — 
despite  large  sums  of  money  spent  to  import  parasitic  insects  to 
control  it. 

There  was  once  a  society  in  Hawaii  for  the  special  purpose  of 
introducing  exotic  birds.  Today  when  you  go  to  the  islands,  you 
see,  instead  of  the  exquisite  native  birds  that  greeted  Captain 
Cook,  mynas  from  India,  cardinals  from  the  United  States  or 
Brazil,  doves  from  Asia,  weavers  from  Australia,  skylarks  from 
Europe,  and  titmice  from  Japan.  Most  of  the  original  bird  life 
has  been  wiped  out,  and  to  find  its  fugitive  remnants  you  would 
have  to  search  assiduously  in  the  most  remote  hills.

Some  of  the  island  species  have,  at  best,  the  most  tenuous  hold 
on  life.  The  Laysan  teal  is  found  nowhere  in  the  world  but  on 
the  one  small  island  of  Laysan.  Even  on  this  island  it  occurs  only 
on  one  end,  where  there  is  a  seepage  of  fresh  water.  Probably  the 
total  population  of  this  species  does  not  exceed  fifty  individuals. 
Destruction  of  the  small  swampy  bit  of  land  that  is  its  home,  or 
the  introduction  of  a  hostile  or  competing  species,  could  easily 
snap  the  slender  thread  of  life. 

Most  of  man's  habitual  tampering  with  nature's  balance  by 
introducing  exotic  species  has  been  done  in  ignorance  of  the  fatal 
chain  of  events  that  would  follow.  But  in  modern  times,  at  least, 
we  might  profit  by  history.  About  the  year  1513,  the  Portuguese 
introduced  goats  onto  the  recently  discovered  island  of  St. 
Helena,  which  had  developed  a  magnificent  forest  of  gumwood, 
ebony,  and  brazilwood.  By  1560  or  thereabouts,  the  goats  had  so 
multiplied  that  they  wandered  over  the  island  by  the  thousand, 
m  flocks  a  mile  long.  They  trampled  the  young  trees  and  ate  the 
seedlings.  By  this  time  the  colonists  had  begun  to  cut  and  burn 
the  forests,  so  that  it  is  hard  to  say  whether  men  or  goats  were 
the  more  responsible  for  the  destruction.  But  of  the  result  there 
was  no  doubt.  By  the  early  1800's  the  forests  were  gone,  and  the 
naturalist  Alfred  Wallace  later  described  this  once  beautiful, 
forest-clad  volcanic  island  as  a  ‘rocky  desert,'  in  which  the  rem¬ 
nants  of  the  original  flora  persisted  only  in  the  most  inaccessible 
peaks  and  crater  ridges. 

When  the  astronomer  Halley  visited  the  islands  of  the  At¬ 
lantic  about  1700,  he  put  a  few  goats  ashore  on  South  Trinidad. 
This  time,  without  the  further  aid  of  man,  the  work  of  de¬ 
forestation  proceeded  so  rapidly  that  it  was  nearly  completed 
within  the  century.  Today  Trinidad's  slopes  are  the  place  of  a 
ghost  forest,  strewn  with  the  fallen  and  decaying  trunks  of  long- 
dead  trees;  its  soft  volcanic  soils,  no  longer  held  by  the  interlac¬ 
ing  roots,  are  sliding  away  into  the  sea. 

One  of  the  most  interesting  of  the  Pacific  islands  was  Laysan, 
a  tiny  scrap  of  soil  which  is  a  far  outrider  of  the  Hawaiian  chain. 
It  once  supported  a  forest  of  sandalwood  and  fanleaf  palms  and 
had  five  land  birds,  all  peculiar  to  Laysan  alone.  One  of  them  was 


The  Birth  of  an  Island 


93 


the  Laysan  rail,  a  charming,  gnomelike  creature  no  more  than  six 
inches  high,  with  wings  that  seemed  too  small  (and  were  never 
used  as  wings),  and  feet  that  seemed  too  large,  and  a  voice  like 
distant,  tinkling  bells.  About  1887,  the  captain  of  a  visiting  ship 
moved  some  of  the  rails  to  Midway,  about  300  miles  to  the  west, 
establishing  a  second  colony.  It  seemed  a  fortunate  move,  for 
soon  thereafter  rabbits  were  introduced  on  Laysan.  Within  a 
quarter  of  a  century,  the  rabbits  had  killed  off  the  vegetation  of 
the  tiny  island,  reduced  it  to  a  sandy  desert,  and  all  but  exter¬ 
minated  themselves.  As  for  the  rails,  the  devastation  of  their 
island  was  fatal,  and  the  last  rail  died  about  1924. 

Perhaps  the  Laysan  colony  could  later  have  been  restored  from 
the  Midway  group  had  not  tragedy  struck  there  also.  During  the 
war  in  the  Pacific,  rats  went  ashore  to  island  after  island  from 
ships  and  landing  craft.  They  invaded  Midway  in  1943.  The 
adult  rails  were  slaughtered.  The  eggs  were  eaten,  and  the  young 
birds  killed.  The  world’s  last  Laysan  rail  was  seen  in  1944. 

The  tragedy  of  the  oceanic  islands  lies  in  the  uniqueness,  the 
irreplaceability  of  the  species  they  have  developed  by  the  slow 
processes  of  the  ages.  In  a  reasonable  world  men  would  have 
treated  these  islands  as  precious  possessions,  as  natural  museums 
filled  with  beautiful  and  curious  works  of  creation,  valuable  be¬ 
yond  price  because  nowhere  in  the  world  are  they  duplicated. 
W.  H.  Hudson’s  lament  for  the  birds  of  the  Argentine  pampas 
might  even  more  truly  have  been  spoken  of  the  islands:  'The 
beautiful  has  vanished  and  returns  not.’ 


The  Shape  of  Ancient  Seas 


TILL  THE  SLOW  SEA  RISE  AND  THE  SHEER  CLIFF  CRUMBLE, 
TILL  TERRACE  AND  MEADOW  THE  DEEP  GULFS  DRINK. 

— Swinburne 


w.  live  in  an  age  of  rising  seas.  Along  all  the  coasts  of  the 
United  States  a  continuing  rise  of  sea  level  has  been  perceptible 
on  the  tide  gauges  of  the  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey  since  1930. 
For  the  thousand-mile  stretch  from  Massachusetts  to  Florida, 
and  on  the  coast  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  the  rise  amounted  to 
about  a  third  of  a  foot  between  1930  and  1948.  The  water  is  also 
rising  (but  more  slowly)  along  the  Pacific  shores.  These  records 
of  the  tide  gauges  do  not  include  the  transient  advances  and 
retreats  of  the  water  caused  by  winds  and  storms,  but  signify  a 
steady,  continuing  advance  of  the  sea  upon  the  land. 

This  evidence  of  a  rising  sea  is  an  interesting  and  even  an  ex¬ 
citing  thing  because  it  is  rare  that,  in  the  short  span  of  human 
life,  we  can  actually  observe  and  measure  the  progress  of  one  of 
the  great  earth  rhythms.  What  is  happening  is  nothing  new. 
Over  the  long  span  of  geologic  time,  the  ocean  waters  have  come 
in  over  North  America  many  times  and  have  again  retreated  into 
their  basins.  For  the  boundary  between  sea  and  land  is  the  most 
fleeting  and  transitory  feature  of  the  earth,  and  the  sea  is  forever 


The  Shape  of  Ancient  Seas

repeating  its  encroachments  upon  the  continents.  It  rises  and 
falls  like  a  great  tide,  sometimes  engulfing  half  a  continent  in  its 
flood,  reluctant  in  its  ebb,  moving  in  a  rhythm  mysterious  and 
infinitely  deliberate. 

Now  once  again  the  ocean  is  overfull.  It  is  spilling  over  the 
rims  of  its  basins.  It  fills  the  shallow  seas  that  border  the  conti¬ 
nents,  like  the  Barents,  Bering,  and  China  seas.  Here  and  there 
it  has  advanced  into  the  interior  and  lies  in  such  inland  seas  as 
Hudson  Bay,  the  St.  Lawrence  embayment,  the  Baltic,  and  the 
Sunda  Sea.  On  the  Atlantic  coast  of  the  United  States  the 
mouths  of  many  rivers,  like  the  Hudson  and  the  Susquehanna, 
have  been  drowned  by  the  advancing  flood;  the  old,  submerged 
channels  are  hidden  under  bays  like  the  Chesapeake  and  the 
Delaware. 

The  advance  noted  so  clearly  on  the  tide  gauges  may  be  part 
of  a  long  rise  that  began  thousands  of  years  ago— perhaps  when 
the  glaciers  of  the  most  recent  Ice  Age  began  to  melt.  But  it  is 
only  within  recent  decades  that  there  have  been  instruments  to 
measure  it  in  any  part  of  the  world.  Even  now  the  gauges  are 
few  and  scattered,  considering  the  world  as  a  whole.  Because  of 
the  scarcity  of  world  records,  it  is  not  known  whether  the  rise 
observed  in  the  United  States  since  1930  is  being  duplicated  on 
all  other  continents. 

Where  and  when  the  ocean  will  halt  its  present  advance  and 
begin  again  its  slow  retreat  into  its  basin,  no  one  can  say.  If  the 
rise  over  the  continent  of  North  America  should  amount  to  a 
hundred  feet  (and  there  is  more  than  enough  water  now  frozen 
in  land  ice  to  provide  such  a  rise)  most  of  the  Atlantic  seaboard, 
with  its  cities  and  towns,  would  be  submerged.  The  surf  would 
break  against  the  foothills  of  the  Appalachians.  The  coastal  plain 
of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  would  lie  under  water;  the  lower  part  of 
the  Mississippi  Valley  would  be  submerged. 

If,  however,  the  rise  should  be  as  much  as  600  feet,  large  areas 
in  the  eastern  half  of  the  continent  would  disappear  under  the 
waters.  The  Appalachians  would  become  a  chain  of  mountainous 
islands.  The  Gulf  of  Mexico  would  creep  north,  finally  meeting 
in  mid-continent  with  the  flood  that  had  entered  from  the  At- 


9^  Mother  Sea 

lantic  into  the  Great  Lakes,  through  the  valley  of  the  St.  Law¬ 
rence.  Much  of  northern  Canada  would  be  covered  by  water 
from  the  Arctic  Ocean  and  Hudson  Bay. 

All  of  this  would  seem  to  us  extraordinary  and  catastrophic, 
but  the  truth  is  that  North  America  and  most  other  continents 
have  known  even  more  extensive  invasions  by  the  sea  than  the 
one  we  have  just  imagined.  Probably  the  greatest  submergence 
in  the  history  of  the  earth  took  place  in  the  Cretaceous  period, 
about  100  million  years  ago.  Then  the  ocean  waters  advanced 
upon  North  America  from  the  north,  south,  and  east,  finally  form¬ 
ing  an  inland  sea  about  1000  miles  wide  that  extended  from  the 
Arctic  to  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  and  then  spread  eastward  to  cover 
the  coastal  plain  from  the  Gulf  to  New  Jersey.  At  the  height  of 
the  Cretaceous  flood  about  half  of  North  America  was  sub¬ 
merged.  All  over  the  world  the  seas  rose.  They  covered  most  of 
the  British  Isles,  except  for  scattered  outcroppings  of  ancient 
rocks.  In  southern  Europe  only  the  old,  rocky  highlands  stood 
above  the  sea,  which  intruded  in  long  bays  and  gulfs  even  into 
the  central  highlands  of  the  continent.  The  ocean  moved  into 
Africa  and  laid  down  deposits  of  sandstones;  later  weathering  of 
these  rocks  provided  the  desert  sands  of  the  Sahara.  From  a 
drowned  Sweden,  an  inland  sea  flowed  across  Russia,  covered 
the  Caspian  Sea,  and  extended  to  the  Himalayas.  Parts  of  India 
were  submerged,  and  of  Australia,  Japan,  and  Siberia.  On  the 
South  American  continent,  the  area  where  later  the  Andes  were 
to  rise  was  covered  by  sea. 

With  variations  of  extent  and  detail,  these  events  have  been 
repeated  again  and  again.  The  very  ancient  Ordovician  seas, 
some  400  million  years  ago,  submerged  more  than  half  of  North 
America,  leaving  only  a  few  large  islands  marking  the  border¬ 
lands  of  the  continent,  and  a  scattering  of  smaller  ones  rising  out 
of  the  inland  sea.  The  marine  transgressions  of  Devonian  and 
Silurian  time  were  almost  as  extensive.  But  each  time  the  pattern 
of  invasion  was  a  little  different,  and  it  is  doubtful  that  there  is 
any  part  of  the  continent  that  at  some  time  has  not  lain  at  the 
bottom  of  one  of  these  shallow  seas. 

You  do  not  have  to  travel  to  find  the  sea,  for  the  traces  of  its 


The  Shape  of  Ancient  Seas

ancient  stands  are  everywhere  about.  Though  you  may  be  a  thou¬ 
sand  miles  inland,  you  can  easily  find  reminders  that  will  recon¬ 
struct  for  the  eye  and  ear  of  the  mind  the  processions  of  its 
ghostly  waves  and  the  roar  of  its  surf,  far  back  in  time.  So,  on  a 
mountain  top  in  Pennsylvania,  I  have  sat  on  rocks  of  whitened 
limestone,  fashioned  of  the  shells  of  billions  upon  billions  of 
minute  sea  creatures.  Once  they  had  lived  and  died  in  an  arm  of 
the  ocean  that  overlay  this  place,  and  their  limy  remains  had 
settled  to  the  bottom.  There,  after  eons  of  time,  they  had  be¬ 
come  compacted  into  rock  and  the  sea  had  receded;  after  yet 
more  eons  the  rock  had  been  uplifted  by  bucklings  of  the  earth’s 
crust  and  now  it  formed  the  backbone  of  a  long  mountain  range. 

Far  in  the  interior  of  the  Florida  Everglades  I  have  wondered 
at  the  feeling  of  the  sea  that  came  to  me— wondered  until  I  real¬ 
ized  that  here  were  the  same  flatness,  the  same  immense  spaces, 
the  same  dominance  of  the  sky  and  its  moving,  changing  clouds; 
wondered  until  I  remembered  that  the  hard  rocky  floor  on  which 
I  stood,  its  flatness  interrupted  by  upthrust  masses  of  jagged  coral 
rock,  had  been  only  recently  constructed  by  the  busy  architects 
of  the  coral  reefs  under  a  warm  sea.  Now  the  rock  is  thinly  cov¬ 
ered  with  grass  and  water;  but  everywhere  is  the  feeling  that  the 
land  has  formed  only  the  thinnest  veneer  over  the  underlying 
platform  of  the  sea,  that  at  any  moment  the  process  might  be 
reversed  and  the  sea  reclaim  its  own. 

So  in  all  lands  we  may  sense  the  former  presence  of  the  sea. 
There  are  outcroppings  of  marine  limestone  in  the  Himalayas, 
now  at  an  elevation  of  20,000  feet.  These  rocks  are  reminders  of 
a  warm,  clear  sea  that  lay  over  southern  Europe  and  northern 
Africa  and  extended  into  southwestern  Asia.  This  was  some  50 
million  years  ago.  Immense  numbers  of  a  large  protozoan  known 
as  nummulites  swarmed  in  this  sea  and  each,  in  death,  contrib¬ 
uted  to  the  building  of  a  thick  layer  of  nummulitic  limestone. 
Eons  later,  the  ancient  Egyptians  were  to  carve  their  Sphinx 
from  a  mass  of  this  rock;  other  deposits  of  the  same  stone  they 
quarried  to  obtain  material  to  build  their  pyramids. 

The  famous  white  cliffs  of  Dover  are  composed  of  chalk  de¬ 
posited  by  the  seas  of  the  Cretaceous  period,  during  that  great 


9^  Mother  Sea 

inundation  we  have  spoken  of.  The  chalk  extends  from  Ireland 
through  Denmark  and  Germany,  and  forms  its  thickest  beds  in 
south  Russia.  It  consists  of  shells  of  those  minute  sea  creatures 
called  foraminifera,  the  shells  being  cemented  together  with  a 
fine-textured  deposit  of  calcium  carbonate.  In  contrast  to  the 
foraminiferal  ooze  that  covers  large  areas  of  ocean  bottom  at 
moderate  depths,  the  chalk  seems  to  be  a  shallow-water  deposit, 
but  it  is  so  pure  in  texture  that  the  surrounding  lands  must  have 
been  low  deserts,  from  which  little  material  was  carried  seaward. 
Grains  of  wind-borne  quartz  sand,  which  frequently  occur  in  the 
chalk,  support  this  view.  At  certain  levels  the  chalk  contains 
nodules  of  flint.  Stone  Age  men  mined  the  flint  for  weapons  and 
tools  and  also  used  this  relic  of  the  Cretaceous  sea  to  light  their 
fires. 

Many  of  the  natural  wonders  of  the  earth  owe  their  existence 
to  the  fact  that  once  the  sea  crept  over  the  land,  laid  down  its 
deposits  of  sediments,  and  then  withdrew.  There  is  Mammoth 
Cave  in  Kentucky,  for  example,  where  one  may  wander  through 
miles  of  underground  passages  and  enter  rooms  with  ceilings  250 
feet  overhead.  Caves  and  passageways  have  been  dissolved  by 
ground  water  out  of  an  immense  thickness  of  limestone,  depos¬ 
ited  by  a  Paleozoic  sea.  In  the  same  way,  the  story  of  Niagara 
Falls  goes  back  to  Silurian  time,  when  a  vast  embayment  of  the 
Arctic  Sea  crept  southward  over  the  continent.  Its  waters  were 
clear,  for  the  borderlands  were  low  and  little  sediment  or  silt  was 
carried  into  the  inland  sea.  It  deposited  large  beds  of  the  hard 
rock  called  dolomite,  and  in  time  they  formed  a  long  escarpment 
near  the  present  border  between  Canada  and  the  United  States. 
Millions  of  years  later,  floods  of  water  released  from  melting 
glaciers  poured  over  this  cliff,  cutting  away  the  soft  shales  that 
underlay  the  dolomite,  and  causing  mass  after  mass  of  the  under¬ 
cut  rock  to  break  away.  In  this  fashion  Niagara  Falls  and  its 
gorge  were  created. 

Some  of  these  inland  seas  were  immense  and  important  fea¬ 
tures  of  their  world,  although  all  of  them  were  shallow  compared 
with  the  central  basin  where,  since  earliest  time,  the  bulk  of  the 
ocean  waters  have  resided.  Some  may  have  been  as  much  as  600

feet  deep,  about  the  same  as  the  depths  over  the  outer  edge  of 
the  continental  shelf.  No  one  knows  the  pattern  of  their  currents, 
but  often  they  must  have  carried  the  warmth  of  the  tropics  into 
far  northern  lands.  During  the  Cretaceous  period,  for  example, 
breadfruit,  cinnamon,  laurel,  and  fig  trees  grew  in  Greenland. 
When  the  continents  were  reduced  to  groups  of  islands  there 
must  have  been  few  places  that  possessed  a  continental  type  of 
climate  with  its  harsh  extremes  of  heat  and  cold;  mild  oceanic 
climates  must  rather  have  been  the  rule. 

Geologists  say  that  each  of  the  grander  divisions  of  earth  his¬ 
tory  consists  of  three  phases:  in  the  first  the  continents  are  high, 
erosion  is  active,  and  the  seas  are  largely  confined  to  their  basins; 
in  the  second  the  continents  are  lowest  and  the  seas  have  invaded 
them  broadly;  in  the  third  the  continents  have  begun  once  more 
to  rise.  According  to  the  late  Charles  Schuchert,  who  devoted 
much  of  his  distinguished  career  as  a  geologist  to  mapping  the 
ancient  seas  and  lands:  'Today  we  are  living  in  the  beginning 
of  a  new  cycle,  when  the  continents  are  largest,  highest,  and 
scenically  grandest.  The  oceans,  however,  have  begun  another 
invasion  upon  North  America.’ 

What  brings  the  ocean  out  of  its  deep  basins,  where  it  has 
been  contained  for  eons  of  time,  to  invade  the  lands?  Probably 
there  has  always  been  not  one  alone,  but  a  combination  of 
causes. 

The  mobility  of  the  earth’s  crust  is  inseparably  linked  with  the 
changing  relations  of  sea  and  land— the  warping  upward  or 
downward  of  that  surprisingly  plastic  substance  which  forms  the 
outer  covering  of  our  earth.  The  crustal  movements  affect  both 
land  and  sea  bottom  but  are  most  marked  near  the  continental 
margins.  They  may  involve  one  or  both  shores  of  an  ocean, 
one  or  all  coasts  of  a  continent.  They  proceed  in  a  slow  and  mys¬ 
terious  cycle,  one  phase  of  which  may  require  millions  of  years 
for  its  completion.  Each  downward  movement  of  the  continental 
crust  is  accompanied  by  a  slow  flooding  of  the  land  by  the  sea, 
each  upward  buckling  by  the  retreat  of  the  water. 

But  the  movements  of  the  earth’s  crust  are  not  alone  respon¬ 
sible  for  the  invading  seas.  There  are  other  important  causes.

Mother  Sea 

Certainly  one  of  them  is  the  displacement  of  ocean  water  by  land 
sediments.  Every  grain  of  sand  or  silt  carried  out  by  the  rivers 
and  deposited  at  sea  displaces  a  corresponding  amount  of  water. 
Disintegration  of  the  land  and  the  seaward  freighting  of  its  sub¬ 
stance  have  gone  on  without  interruption  since  the  beginning  of 
geologic  time.  It  might  be  thought  that  the  sea  level  would  have 
been  rising  continuously,  but  the  matter  is  not  so  simple.  As  they 
lose  substance  the  continents  tend  to  rise  higher,  like  a  ship  re¬ 
lieved  of  part  of  its  cargo.  The  ocean  floor,  to  which  the  sedi¬ 
ments  are  transferred,  sags  under  its  load.  The  exact  combination 
of  all  these  conditions  that  will  result  in  a  rising  ocean  level  is 
a  very  complex  matter,  not  easily  recognized  or  predicted. 

Then  there  is  the  growth  of  the  great  submarine  volcanoes, 
which  build  up  immense  lava  cones  on  the  floor  of  the  ocean. 
Some  geologists  believe  these  may  have  an  important  effect  on 
the  changing  level  of  the  sea.  The  bulk  of  some  of  these  vol¬ 
canoes  is  impressive.  Bermuda  is  one  of  the  smallest,  but  its  vol¬ 
ume  beneath  the  surface  is  about  2500  cubic  miles.  The 
Hawaiian  chain  of  volcanic  islands  extends  for  nearly  2000  miles 
across  the  Pacific  and  contains  several  islands  of  great  size;  its 
total  displacement  of  water  must  be  tremendous.  Perhaps  it  is 
more  than  coincidence  that  this  chain  arose  in  Cretaceous  time, 
when  the  greatest  flood  the  world  has  ever  seen  advanced  upon 
the  continents. 

For  the  past  million  years,  all  other  causes  of  marine  trans¬ 
gressions  have  been  dwarfed  by  the  dominating  role  of  the 
glaciers.  The  Pleistocene  period  was  marked  by  alternating  ad¬ 
vances  and  retreats  of  a  great  ice  sheet.  Four  times  the  ice  caps 
formed  and  grew  deep  over  the  land,  pressing  southward  into  the 
valleys  and  over  the  plains.  And  four  times  the  ice  melted  and 
shrank  and  withdrew  from  the  lands  it  had  covered.  We  live  now 
in  the  last  stages  of  this  fourth  withdrawal.  About  half  the  ice 
formed  in  the  last  Pleistocene  glaciation  remains  in  the  ice  caps 
of  Greenland  and  Antarctica  and  the  scattered  glaciers  of  certain 
mountains. 

Each  time  the  ice  sheet  thickened  and  expanded  with  the  un¬ 
melted  snows  of  winter  after  winter,  its  growth  meant  a  corre-

sponding  lowering  of  the  ocean  level.  For  directly  or  indirectly, 
the  moisture  that  falls  on  the  earth’s  surface  as  rain  or  snow  has 
been  withdrawn  from  the  reservoir  of  the  sea.  Ordinarily,  the 
withdrawal  is  a  temporary  one,  the  water  being  returned  via  the 
normal  runoff  of  rain  and  melting  snow.  But  in  the  glacial  period 
the  summers  were  cool,  and  the  snows  of  any  winter  did  not  melt 
entirelv  but  were  carried  over  to  the  succeeding  winter,  when 
the  new  snows  found  and  covered  them.  So  little  by  little  the 
level  of  the  sea  dropped  as  the  glaciers  robbed  it  of  its  water, 
and  at  the  climax  of  each  of  the  major  glaciations  the  ocean  all 
over  the  world  stood  at  a  very  low  level. 

Today,  if  you  look  in  the  right  places,  you  will  see  the  evi¬ 
dences  of  some  of  these  old  stands  of  the  sea.  Of  course  the 
strand  marks  left  by  the  extreme  low  levels  are  now  deeply  cov¬ 
ered  by  water  and  may  be  discovered  only  indirectly  by  sounding. 
But  where,  in  past  ages,  the  water  level  stood  higher  than  it  does 
today  you  can  find  its  traces.  In  Samoa,  at  the  foot  of  a  cliff  wall 
now  15  feet  above  the  present  level  of  the  sea,  you  can  find 
benches  cut  in  the  rocks  by  waves.  You  will  find  the  same  thing 
on  other  Pacific  islands,  and  on  St.  Helena  in  the  South  Atlantic, 
on  islands  of  the  Indian  Ocean,  in  the  West  Indies,  and  around 
the  Cape  of  Good  Hope. 

Sea  caves  in  cliffs  now  high  above  the  battering  assault  and 
the  flung  spray  of  the  waves  that  cut  them  are  eloquent  of  the 
changed  relation  of  sea  and  land.  You  will  find  such  caves  widely 
scattered  over  the  world.  On  the  west  coast  of  Norway  there  is  a 
remarkable,  wave-cut  tunnel.  Out  of  the  hard  granite  of  the 
island  of  Torghattan,  the  pounding  surf  of  a  flooding  interglacial 
sea  cut  a  passageway  through  the  island,  a  distance  of  about  530 
feet,  and  in  so  doing  removed  nearly  5  million  cubic  feet  of  rock. 
The  tunnel  now  stands  400  feet  above  the  sea.  Its  elevation  is 
due  in  part  to  the  elastic,  upward  rebound  of  the  crust  after  the 
melting  of  the  ice. 

During  the  other  half  of  the  cycle,  when  the  seas  sank  lower 
and  lower  as  the  glaciers  grew  in  thickness,  the  world’s  shore¬ 
lines  were  undergoing  changes  even  more  far-reaching  and  dra¬ 
matic.  Every  river  felt  the  effect  of  the  lowering  sea;  its  waters 


102 


Mother  Sea 

were  speeded  in  their  course  to  the  ocean  and  given  new  strength 
for  the  deepening  and  cutting  of  its  channel.  Following  the 
downward-moving  shorelines,  the  rivers  extended  their  courses 
over  the  drying  sands  and  muds  of  what  only  recently  had  been 
the  sloping  sea  bottom.  Here  the  rushing  torrents— swollen  with 
melting  glacier  water— picked  up  great  quantities  of  loose  mud 
and  sand  and  rolled  into  the  sea  as  a  turgid  flood. 

During  one  or  more  of  the  Pleistocene  lowerings  of  sea  level, 
the  floor  of  the  North  Sea  was  drained  of  its  water  and  for  a  time 
became  dry  land.  The  rivers  of  northern  Europe  and  of  the  Brit¬ 
ish  Isles  followed  the  retreating  waters  seaward.  Eventually  the 
Rhine  captured  the  whole  drainage  system  of  the  Thames.  The 
Elbe  and  the  Weser  became  one  river.  The  Seine  rolled  through 
what  is  now  the  English  Channel  and  cut  itself  a  trough  out 
across  the  continental  shelf— perhaps  the  same  drowned  channel 
now  discernible  by  soundings  beyond  Lands  End. 

The  greatest  of  all  Pleistocene  glaciations  came  rather  late  in 
the  period — probably  only  about  200  thousand  years  ago,  and 
well  within  the  time  of  man.  The  tremendous  lowering  of  sea 
level  must  have  affected  the  life  of  Paleolithic  man.  Certainly  he 
was  able,  at  more  than  one  period,  to  walk  across  a  wide  bridge 
at  Bering  Strait,  which  became  dry  land  when  the  level  of  the 
ocean  dropped  below  this  shallow  shelf.  There  were  other  land 
bridges,  created  in  the  same  way.  As  the  ocean  receded  from  the 
coast  of  India,  a  long  submarine  bank  became  a  shoal,  then  fi¬ 
nally  emerged,  and  primitive  man  walked  across  ‘Adam’s  Bridge’ 
to  the  island  of  Ceylon. 

Many  of  the  settlements  of  ancient  man  must  have  been  lo¬ 
cated  on  the  seacoast  or  near  the  great  deltas  of  the  rivers,  and 
relics  of  his  civilization  may  lie  in  caves  long  since  covered  by  the 
rising  ocean.  Our  meager  knowledge  of  Paleolithic  man  might 
be  increased  by  searching  along  these  old  drowned  shorelines. 
One  archaeologist  has  recommended  searching  shallow  portions 
of  the  Adriatic  Sea,  with  ‘submarine  boats  casting  strong  electric 
lights’  or  even  with  glass-bottomed  boats  and  artificial  light  in 
the  hope  of  discovering  the  outlines  of  shell  heaps— the  kitchen

middens  of  the  early  men  who  once  lived  here.  Professor  R.  A. 
Daly  has  pointed  out: 

The  last  Glacial  stage  was  the  Reindeer  Age  of  French  history. 
Men  then  lived  in  the  famous  caves  overlooking  the  channels  of 
the  French  rivers,  and  hunted  the  reindeer  which  throve  on  the 
cool  plains  of  France  south  of  the  ice  border.  The  Late-Glacial 
rise  of  general  sealevel  was  necessarily  accompanied  by  a  rise  of 
the  river  waters  downstream.  Hence  the  lowest  caves  are  likely 
to  have  been  partly  or  wholly  drowned  . .  .  There  the  search  for 
more  relics  of  Paleolithic  man  should  be  pursued.* 

Some  of  our  Stone  Age  ancestors  must  have  known  the  rigors 
of  life  near  the  glaciers.  While  men  as  well  as  plants  and  animals 
moved  southward  before  the  ice,  some  must  have  remained 
within  sight  and  sound  of  the  great  frozen  wall.  To  these  the 
world  was  a  place  of  storm  and  blizzard,  with  bitter  winds  roar¬ 
ing  down  out  of  the  blue  mountain  of  ice  that  dominated  the 
horizon  and  reached  upward  into  gray  skies,  all  filled  with  the 
roaring  tumult  of  the  advancing  glacier,  and  with  the  thunder  of 
moving  tons  of  ice  breaking  away  and  plunging  into  the  sea. 

But  those  who  lived  half  the  earth  away,  on  some  sunny  coast 
of  the  Indian  Ocean,  walked  and  hunted  on  dry  land  over  which 
the  sea,  only  recently,  had  rolled  deeply.  These  men  knew  noth¬ 
ing  of  the  distant  glaciers,  nor  did  they  understand  that  they 
walked  and  hunted  where  they  did  because  quantities  of  ocean 
water  were  frozen  as  ice  and  snow  in  a  distant  land. 

In  any  imaginative  reconstruction  of  the  world  of  the  Ice  Age, 
we  are  plagued  by  one  tantalizing  uncertainty:  how  low  did  the 
ocean  level  fall  during  the  period  of  greatest  spread  of  the  gla¬ 
ciers,  when  unknown  quantities  of  water  were  frozen  in  the  ice? 
Was  it  only  a  moderate  fall  of  200  or  300  feet— a  change  paral¬ 
leled  many  times  in  geologic  history  in  the  ebb  and  flow  of  the 
epicontinental  seas?  Or  was  it  a  dramatic  drawing  down  of  the 
ocean  by  2000,  even  3000  feet?

Each  of  these  various  levels  has  been  suggested  as  an  actual 
possibility  by  one  or  more  geologists.  Perhaps  it  is  not  surprising 
that  there  should  be  such  radical  disagreement.  It  has  been  only 
about  a  century  since  Louis  Agassiz  gave  the  world  its  first  un¬ 
derstanding  of  the  moving  mountains  of  ice  and  their  dominat¬ 
ing  effect  on  the  Pleistocene  world.  Since  then,  men  in  all  parts 
of  the  earth  have  been  patiently  accumulating  the  facts  and 
reconstructing  the  events  of  those  four  successive  advances  and 
retreats  of  the  ice.  Only  the  present  generation  of  scientists,  led 
by  such  daring  thinkers  as  Daly,  have  understood  that  each 
thickening  of  the  ice  sheets  meant  a  corresponding  lowering  of 
the  ocean,  and  that  with  each  retreat  of  the  melting  ice  a  return¬ 
ing  flood  of  water  raised  the  sea  level. 

Of  this  'alternate  robbery  and  restitution'  most  geologists  have 
taken  a  conservative  view  and  said  that  the  greatest  lowering  of 
the  sea  level  could  not  have  amounted  to  more  than  400  feet, 
possibly  only  half  as  much.  Most  of  those  who  argue  that  the 
drawing  down  was  much  greater  base  their  reasoning  upon  the 
submarine  canyons,  those  deep  gorges  cut  in  the  continental 
slopes.  The  deeper  canyons  lie  a  mile  or  more  below  the  present 
level  of  the  sea.  Geologists  who  maintain  that  at  least  the  upper 
parts  of  the  canyons  were  stream-cut  say  that  the  sea  level  must 
have  fallen  enough  to  permit  this  during  the  Pleistocene  glaci¬ 
ation. 

This  question  of  the  farthest  retreat  of  the  sea  into  its  basins 
must  await  further  searchings  into  the  mysteries  of  the  ocean. 
We  seem  on  the  verge  of  exciting  new  discoveries.  Now  oceanog¬ 
raphers  and  geologists  have  better  instruments  than  ever  before 
to  probe  the  depths  of  the  sea,  to  sample  its  rocks  and  deeply 
layered  sediments,  and  to  read  with  greater  clarity  the  dim  pages 
of  past  history. 

Meanwhile,  the  sea  ebbs  and  flows  in  these  grander  tides  of 
earth,  whose  stages  are  measurable  not  in  hours  but  in  millennia 
— tides  so  vast  they  are  invisible  and  uncomprehended  by  the 
senses  of  man.  Their  ultimate  cause,  should  it  ever  be  discov¬ 
ered,  may  be  found  to  be  deep  within  the  fiery  center  of  the 
earth,  or  it  may  he  somewhere  in  the  dark  spaces  of  the  universe.

tip  of  England  they  bring  the  feel  of  the  distant  places  of  the 
Atlantic.  Moving  shoreward  above  the  steeply  rising  floor  of  the 
deep  sea,  from  dark  blue  water  into  troubled  green,  they  pass  the 
edge  of  'soundings’  and  roll  up  over  the  continental  shelf  in  con¬ 
fused  ripplings  and  turbulence.  Over  the  shoaling  bottom  they 
sweep  landward,  breaking  on  the  Seven  Stones  of  the  channel 
between  the  Scilly  Isles  and  Lands  End,  coming  in  over  the 
sunken  ledges  and  the  rocks  that  roll  out  their  glistening  backs 
at  low  water.  As  they  approach  the  rocky  tip  of  Lands  End,  they 
pass  over  a  strange  instrument  lying  on  the  sea  bottom.  By  the 
fluctuating  pressure  of  their  rise  and  fall  they  tell  this  instrument 
many  things  of  the  distant  Atlantic  waters  from  which  they  have 
come,  and  their  messages  are  translated  by  its  mechanisms  into 
symbols  understandable  to  the  human  mind.

messages  of  far-off  places.  He  could  tell  you  where  the  waves 
were  created  by  the  action  of  wind  on  water,  the  strength  of  the 
winds  that  produced  them,  how  fast  the  storm  is  moving,  and 
how  soon,  if  at  all,  it  will  become  necessary  to  raise  storm  warn¬ 
ings  along  the  coast  of  England.  Most  of  the  waves  that  roll  over 
t  le  recorder  at  Lands  End,  he  would  tell  you,  are  born  in  the 
stormy  North  Atlantic  eastward  from  Newfoundland  and  south 
of  Greenland.  Some  can  be  traced  to  tropical  storms  on  the 
opposite  side  of  the  Atlantic,  moving  through  the  West  Indies 
and  along  the  coast  of  Florida.  A  few  have  rolled  up  from  the 
southernmost  part  of  the  world,  taking  a  great-circle  course  all 
the  way  from  Cape  Horn  to  Lands  End,  a  journey  of  6000  miles. 

On  the  coast  of  California  wave  recorders  have  detected  swell 
from  as  great  a  distance,  for  some  of  the  surf  that  breaks  on  that 
coast  in  summer  is  born  in  the  west-wind  belt  of  the  Southern 
Hemisphere.  The  Cornwall  recorders  and  those  in  California  as 
well  as  a  few  on  the  east  coast  of  America,  have  been  in  use 
since  the  end  of  the  Second  World  War.  These  experiments 
have  several  objects,  among  them  the  development  of  a  new  kind 
of  weather  forecasting.  In  the  countries  bordering  the  North  At¬ 
lantic  there  is  no  practical  need  to  turn  to  the  waves  for  weather 
information  because  meteorological  stations  are  numerous  and 
strategically  placed.  The  areas  in  which  the  wave  recorders  are 
presently  used  have  served  rather  as  a  testing  laboratory  to  de¬ 
velop  the  method.  It  will  soon  be  ready  for  use  in  other  parts  of 
the  world,  for  which  there  are  no  meteorological  data  except 
those  the  waves  bring.  Especially  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere, 
many  coasts  are  washed  by  waves  that  have  come  from  lonely,' 
unvisited  parts  of  the  ocean,  seldom  crossed  by  vessels,  off  the 
normal  routes  of  the  air  lines.  Storms  may  develop  in  these  re¬ 
mote  places,  unobserved,  and  sweep  down  suddenly  on  mid¬ 
ocean  islands  or  exposed  coasts.  Over  the  millions  of  years  the 
waves,  running  ahead  of  the  storms,  have  been  crying  a  warning, 
but  only  now  are  we  learning  to  read  their  language.  Or  only 
now,  at  least,  are  we  learning  to  do  so  scientifically.  There  is  a 
basis  in  folklore  for  these  modern  achievements  in  wave  research. 
To  generations  of  Pacific  Island  natives,  a  certain  kind  of  swell

has  signaled  the  approach  of  a  typhoon.  And  centuries  ago,  when 
peasants  on  the  lonely  shores  of  Ireland  saw  the  long  swells  that 
herald  a  storm  rolling  in  upon  their  coasts,  they  shuddered  and 
talked  of  death  waves. 

Now  our  study  of  waves  has  come  of  age,  and  on  all  sides  we 
can  find  evidence  that  modern  man  is  turning  to  the  waves  of  the 
sea  for  practical  purposes.  Off  the  Fishing  Pier  at  Long  Branch, 
New  Jersey,  at  the  end  of  a  quarter-mile  pipeline  on  the  bed  of 
the  ocean,  a  wave-recording  instrument  silently  and  continuously 
takes  note  of  the  arrival  of  waves  from  the  open  Atlantic.  By 
electric  impulses  transmitted  through  the  pipeline,  the  height  of 
each  wave  and  the  interval  between  succeeding  crests  are  trans¬ 
mitted  to  a  shore  station  and  automatically  recorded  as  a  graph. 
These  records  are  carefully  studied  by  the  Beach  Erosion  Board 
of  the  Army  Corps  of  Engineers,  which  is  concerned  about  the 
rate  of  erosion  along  the  New  Jersey  coast. 

Off  the  coast  of  Africa,  high-flying  planes  recently  took  a  series 
of  overlapping  photographs  of  the  surf  and  the  areas  immedi¬ 
ately  offshore.  From  these  photographs,  trained  men  determined 
the  speed  of  the  waves  moving  in  toward  the  shore.  Then  they 
applied  a  mathematical  formula  that  relates  the  behavior  of 
waves  advancing  into  shallow  water  to  the  depths  beneath  them. 
All  this  information  provided  the  British  government  with 
usable  surveys  of  the  depths  off  the  coast  of  an  almost  inacces¬ 
sible  part  of  its  empire,  which  could  have  been  sounded  in  the 
ordinary  way  only  at  great  expense  and  with  endless  difficulty. 
Like  much  of  our  new  knowledge  of  waves,  this  practical  method 
was  born  of  wartime  necessity. 

Forecasts  of  the  state  of  the  sea  and  particularly  the  height  of 
the  surf  became  regular  preliminaries  to  invasion  in  the  Second 
World  War,  especially  on  the  exposed  beaches  of  Europe  and 
Africa.  But  application  of  theory  to  practical  conditions  was  at 
first  difficult;  so  was  the  interpretation  of  the  actual  effect  of  any 
predicted  height  of  surf  or  roughness  of  sea  surface  on  the  trans¬ 
fer  of  men  and  supplies  between  boats  or  from  boats  to  beaches. 
This  first  attempt  at  practical  military  oceanography  was,  as  one 
naval  officer  put  it,  a  'most  frightening  lesson  concerning  the

almost  desperate  lack  of  basic  information  on  the  fundamentals 
of  the  nature  of  the  sea/ 

As  long  as  there  has  been  an  earth,  the  moving  masses  of  air 
that  we  call  winds  have  swept  back  and  forth  across  its  surface. 
And  as  long  as  there  has  been  an  ocean,  its  waters  have  stirred 
to  the  passage  of  the  winds.  Most  waves  are  the  result  of  the 
action  of  wind  on  water.  There  are  exceptions,  such  as  the  tidal 
waves  sometimes  produced  by  earthquakes  under  the  sea.  But 
the  waves  most  of  us  know  best  are  wind  waves. 

It  is  a  confused  pattern  that  the  waves  make  in  the  open  sea— 
a  mixture  of  countless  different  wave  trains,  intermingling,  over¬ 
taking,  passing,  or  sometimes  engulfing  one  another;  each  group 
differing  from  the  others  in  the  place  and  manner  of  its  origin, 
in  its  speed,  its  direction  of  movement;  some  doomed  never  to 
reach  any  shore,  others  destined  to  roll  across  half  an  ocean 
before  they  dissolve  in  thunder  on  a  distant  beach. 

Out  of  such  seemingly  hopeless  confusion  the  patient  study  of 
many  men  over  many  years  has  brought  a  surprising  amount  of 
order.  While  there  is  still  much  to  be  learned  about  waves,  and 
much  to  be  done  to  apply  what  is  known  to  man’s  advantage, 
there  is  a  solid  basis  of  fact  on  which  to  reconstruct  the  life  his¬ 
tory  of  a  wave,  predict  its  behavior  under  all  the  changing  cir¬ 
cumstances  of  its  life,  and  foretell  its  effect  on  human  affairs. 

Before  constructing  an  imaginary  life  history  of  a  typical  wave, 
we  need  to  become  familiar  with  some  of  its  physical  character¬ 
istics.  A  wave  has  height,  from  trough  to  crest.  It  has  length,  the 
distance  from  its  crest  to  that  of  the  following  wave.  The  period 
of  the  wave  refers  to  the  time  required  for  succeeding  crests  to 
pass  a  fixed  point.  None  of  these  dimensions  is  static;  all  change, 
but  bear  definite  relations  to  the  wind,  the  depth  of  the  water, 
and  many  other  matters.  Furthermore,  the  water  that  composes 
a  wave  does  not  advance  with  it  across  the  sea;  each  water  par¬ 
ticle  describes  a  circular  or  elliptical  orbit  with  the  passage  of 
the  wave  form,  but  returns  very  nearly  to  its  original  position. 
And  it  is  fortunate  that  this  is  so,  for  if  the  huge  masses  of  water 
that  comprise  a  wave  actually  moved  across  the  sea,  navigation 
would  be  impossible.  Those  who  deal  professionally  in  the  lore

of  waves  make  frequent  use  of  a  picturesque  expression— the 
'length  of  fetch/  The  'fetch'  is  the  distance  that  the  waves  have 
run,  under  the  drive  of  a  wind  blowing  in  a  constant  direction, 
without  obstruction.  The  greater  the  fetch,  the  higher  the  waves. 
Really  large  waves  cannot  be  generated  within  the  confined  space 
of  a  bay  or  a  small  area.  A  fetch  of  perhaps  600  to  800  miles,  with 
winds  of  gale  velocity,  is  required  to  get  up  the  largest  ocean 
waves. 

Now  let  us  suppose  that,  after  a  period  of  calm,  a  storm  de¬ 
velops  far  out  in  the  Atlantic,  perhaps  a  thousand  miles  from  the 
New  Jersey  coast  where  we  are  spending  a  summer  holiday.  Its 
winds  blow  irregularly,  with  sudden  gusts,  shifting  direction  but 
in  general  blowing  shoreward.  The  sheet  of  water  under  the  wind 
responds  to  the  changing  pressures.  It  is  no  longer  a  level  sur¬ 
face;  it  becomes  furrowed  with  alternating  troughs  and  ridges. 
The  waves  move  toward  the  coast,  and  the  wind  that  created 
them  controls  their  destiny.  As  the  storm  continues  and  the 
waves  move  shoreward,  they  receive  energy  from  the  wind  and 
increase  in  height.  Up  to  a  point  they  will  continue  to  take  to 
themselves  the  fierce  energy  of  the  wind,  growing  in  height  as  the 
strength  of  the  gale  is  absorbed,  but  when  a  wave  becomes  about 
a  seventh  as  high  from  trough  to  crest  as  the  distance  to  the  next 
crest  it  will  begin  to  topple  in  foaming  whitecaps.  Winds  of  hur¬ 
ricane  force  often  blow  the  tops  off  the  waves  by  their  sheer 
violence;  in  such  a  storm  the  highest  waves  may  develop  after  the 
wind  has  begun  to  subside. 

But  to  return  to  our  typical  wave,  born  of  wind  and  water  far 
out  in  the  Atlantic,  grown  to  its  full  height  on  the  energy  of  the 
winds,  with  its  fellow  waves  forming  a  confused,  irregular  pat¬ 
tern  known  as  a  'sea/  As  the  waves  gradually  pass  out  of  the 
storm  area  their  height  diminishes,  the  distance  between  succes¬ 
sive  crests  increases,  and  the  'sea'  becomes  a  swell,  moving  at  an 
average  speed  of  about  15  miles  an  hour.  Near  the  coast  a  pat¬ 
tern  of  long,  regular  swells  is  substituted  for  the  turbulence  of 
open  ocean.  But  as  the  swell  enters  shallow  water  a  startling 
transformation  takes  place.  For  the  first  time  in  its  existence,  the 
wave  feels  the  drag  of  shoaling  bottom.  Its  speed  slackens,  crests

of  following  waves  crowd  in  toward  it,  abruptly  its  height  in¬ 
creases  and  the  wave  form  steepens.  Then  with  a  spilling,  tum¬ 
bling  rush  of  water  falling  down  into  its  trough,  it  dissolves  in  a 
seething  confusion  of  foam. 

An  observer  sitting  on  a  beach  can  make  at  least  an  intelligent 
guess  whether  the  surf  spilling  out  onto  the  sand  before  him  has 
been  produced  by  a  gale  close  offshore  or  by  a  distant  storm. 
Young  waves,  only  recently  shaped  by  the  wind,  have  a  steep, 
peaked  shape  even  well  out  at  sea.  From  far  out  on  the  horizon 
you  can  see  them  forming  whitecaps  as  they  come  in;  bits  of 
foam  are  spilling  down  their  fronts  and  boiling  and  bubbling 
over  the  advancing  face,  and  the  final  breaking  of  the  wave  is  a 
prolonged  and  deliberate  process.  But  if  a  wave,  on  coming  into 
the  surf  zone,  rears  high  as  though  gathering  all  its  strength  for 
the  final  act  of  its  life,  if  the  crest  forms  all  along  its  advancing 
front  and  then  begins  to  curl  forward,  if  the  whole  mass  of  water 
plunges  suddenly  with  a  booming  roar  into  its  trough — then  you 
may  take  it  that  these  waves  are  visitors  from  some  very  distant 
part  of  the  ocean,  that  they  have  traveled  long  and  far  before 
their  final  dissolution  at  your  feet. 

What  is  true  of  the  Atlantic  wave  we  have  followed  is  true,  in 
general,  of  wind  waves  the  world  over.  The  incidents  in  the  life 
of  a  wave  are  many.  How  long  it  will  live,  how  far  it  will  travel, 
to  what  manner  of  end  it  will  come  are  all  determined,  in  large 
measure,  by  the  conditions  it  meets  in  its  progression  across  the 
face  of  the  sea.  For  the  one  essential  quality  of  a  wave  is  that  it 
moves;  anything  that  retards  or  stops  its  motion  dooms  it  to  dis¬ 
solution  and  death. 

Forces  within  the  sea  itself  may  affect  a  wave  most  profoundly. 
Some  of  the  most  terrible  furies  of  the  ocean  are  unleashed  when 
tidal  currents  cross  the  path  of  the  waves  or  move  in  direct  oppo¬ 
sition  to  them.  This  is  the  cause  of  the  famous  ‘roosts*  of  Scot¬ 
land,  like  the  one  off  Sumburgh  Head,  at  the  southernmost  tip 
of  the  Shetland  Islands.  During  northeasterly  winds  the  roost  is 
quiescent,  but  when  the  wind-born  waves  roll  in  from  any  other 
quarter  they  encounter  the  tidal  currents,  either  streaming  shore¬ 
ward  in  flood  or  seaward  on  the  ebb.  It  is  like  the  meeting  of  two 


Wind  and  Water 


wild  beasts.  The  battle  of  the  waves  and  tides  is  fought  over  an 
area  of  sea  that  may  be  three  miles  wide  when  the  tides  are  run¬ 
ning  at  full  strength,  first  off  Sumburgh  Head,  then  gradually 
shifting  seaward,  subsiding  only  with  the  temporary  slackening 
of  the  tide.  In  this  confused,  tumbling,  and  bursting  sea,  vessels 
often  become  entirely  unmanageable  and  sometimes  founder/ 
says  the  British  Islands  Pilot ,  while  others  have  been  tossed 
about  for  days  together.’  Such  dangerous  waters  have  been  per¬ 
sonified  in  many  parts  of  the  world  by  names  that  are  handed 
down  through  generations  of  seafaring  men.  As  in  the  time  of 
our  grandfathers  and  of  their  grandfathers,  the  Bore  of  Dun- 
cansby  and  the  Merry  Men  of  Mey  rage  at  opposite  ends  of  the 
Pentland  Firth,  which  separates  the  Orkney  Islands  from  the 
northern  tip  of  Scotland.  The  sailing  directions  for  the  Firth  in 
the  North  Sea  Pilot  for  1875  contained  a  warning  to  mariners, 
which  is  repeated  verbatim  in  the  modern  Pilot: 

Before  entering  the  Pentland  Firth  all  vessels  should  be  pre¬ 
pared  to  batten  down,  and  the  hatches  of  small  vessels  ought  to 
be  secured  even  in  the  finest  weather,  as  it  is  difficult  to  see  what 
may  be  going  on  in  the  distance,  and  the  transition  from  smooth 
water  to  a  broken  sea  is  so  sudden  that  no  time  is  given  for  mak¬ 
ing  arrangements. 

Both  roosts  are  caused  by  the  meeting  of  swells  from  the  open 
ocean  and  opposing  tidal  currents,  so  that  at  the  east  end  of  the 
Firth  the  Bore  of  Duncansby  is  to  be  feared  with  easterly  swells 
and  a  flood  tide,  and  at  the  west  end  the  Merry  Men  of  Mey 
stage  their  revelries  with  the  ebb  tides  and  a  westerly  swell. 
Then,  according  to  the  Pilot ,  ‘a  sea  is  raised  which  cannot  be 
imagined  by  those  who  have  never  experienced  it. 

Such  a  rip  may  offer  protection  to  the  near-by  coast  by  the 
very  fury  and  uncompromisingness  of  the  struggle  between  waves 
and  tide.  Thomas  Stevenson  long  ago  observed  that  as  long  as 
the  Sumburgh  roost  was  breaking  and  cresting  heavily  off  the 
Head  there  was  little  surf  on  shore;  once  the  strength  of  the  tide 
was  spent  and  it  could  no  longer  run  down  the  seas  a  heav\  surf 
rolled  in  against  the  coast  and  rose  to  great  heights  on  the  cliffs. 


114 


The  Restless  Sea 

And  in  the  western  Atlantic,  the  confused  and  swiftly  running 
tidal  currents  at  the  mouth  of  the  Bay  of  Fundy  offer  such  strong 
opposition  to  waves  approaching  from  any  quarter  from  south¬ 
west  to  southeast  that  such  surf  as  develops  within  the  Bay  is 
almost  entirely  local  in  its  origin. 

Out  in  the  open  sea,  a  train  of  waves  encountering  a  hostile 
wind  may  be  rapidly  destroyed,  for  the  power  that  created  a 
wave  may  also  destroy  it.  So  a  fresh  trade  wind  in  the  Atlantic 
has  often  flattened  out  the  swells  as  they  rolled  down  from  Ice¬ 
land  toward  Africa.  Or  a  friendly  wind,  suddenly  springing  up 
to  blow  in  the  direction  the  waves  are  moving,  may  cause  their 
height  to  increase  at  the  rate  of  a  foot  or  two  per  minute.  Once 
a  group  of  moving  ridges  has  been  created,  the  wind  has  only  to 
fall  into  the  troughs  between  them  to  push  up  their  crests 
rapidly. 

Rocky  ledges,  shoals  of  sand  or  clay  or  rock,  and  coastal  islands 
in  the  mouths  of  bays  all  play  their  part  in  the  fate  of  the  waves 
that  advance  toward  shore.  The  long  swells  that  roll  from  the 
open  ocean  toward  the  shores  of  northern  New  England  seldom 
reach  it  in  full  strength.  Their  energy  is  spent  in  passing  over 
that  great  submerged  highland  known  as  Georges  Bank,  the 
crests  of  whose  highest  hills  approach  the  surface  over  the  Culti¬ 
vator  Shoals.  The  hindrance  of  these  submarine  hills,  and  of  the 
tidal  currents  that  swirl  around  and  across  them,  robs  the  long 
ocean  swells  of  their  power.  Or  islands  scattered  within  a  bay  or 
about  its  mouth  may  so  absorb  the  strength  of  the  waves  that  the 
head  of  the  bay  is  free  from  surf.  Even  scattered  reefs  off  a  coast 
may  offer  it  great  protection,  by  causing  the  highest  waves  to 
break  there,  so  that  they  never  reach  the  shore. 

Ice,  snow,  rain — all  are  enemies  of  the  waves  and  under  proper 
conditions  may  knock  down  a  sea  or  cushion  the  force  of  surf  on 
a  beach.  Within  loose  pack  ice  a  vessel  may  count  on  smooth 
seas  even  if  a  gale  is  raging  and  surf  is  breaking  heavily  about  the 
edges  of  the  pack.  Ice  crystals  forming  in  the  sea  will  smooth 
the  waves  by  increasing  the  friction  between  water  particles; 
even  the  delicate,  crystalline  form  of  a  snowflake  has  such  an 
effect  on  a  smaller  scale.  A  hail  storm  will  knock  down  a  rough

sea,  and  even  a  sudden  downpour  of  rain  may  often  turn  the  sur¬ 
face  of  the  ocean  to  oiled-silk  smoothness,  rippling  to  the  pas¬ 
sage  of  the  swells. 

The  divers  of  ancient  times  who  carried  oil  in  their  mouths  to 
release  beneath  the  surface  when  rough  water  made  their  work 
difficult  were  applying  what  every  seaman  today  knows— that  oil 
appears  to  have  a  calming  effect  on  the  free  waves  of  the  open 
ocean.  Instructions  for  the  use  of  oil  in  emergencies  at  sea  are 
carried  by  most  official  sailing  directions  of  maritime  nations. 
Oil  has  little  effect  on  surf,  however,  once  the  dissolution  of  the 
wave  form  has  begun. 

In  the  Southern  Ocean  where  the  waves  are  not  destroyed  by 
breaking  on  any  beach,  the  great  swells  produced  by  the  west¬ 
erly  winds  roll  around  and  around  the  world.  Here  the  longest 
waves,  and  those  with  the  greatest  sidewise  expanse  of  crest,  are 
formed.  Here,  it  might  be  supposed,  the  highest  waves  would 
also  be  found.  Yet  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  waves  of  the 
Southern  Ocean  surpass  the  giants  of  any  other  ocean.  A  long 
series  of  reports  culled  from  the  publications  of  engineers  and 
ships’  officers  show  that  waves  higher  than  25  feet  from  trough 
to  crest  are  rare  in  all  oceans.  Storm  waves  may  grow  twice  as 
high,  and  if  a  full  gale  blows  long  enough  in  one  direction  to 
have  a  fetch  of  600  to  800  miles,  the  resulting  waves  may  be  even 
higher.  The  greatest  possible  height  of  storm  waves  at  sea  is  a 
much  debated  question,  with  most  textbooks  citing  a  conserva¬ 
tive  60  feet,  and  mariners  stubbornly  describing  much  higher 
waves.  Throughout  the  century  that  has  followed  the  report  of 
Dumont  d’Urville  that  he  encountered  a  wave  100  feet  high  off 
the  Cape  of  Good  Hope,  science  generally  has  viewed  such  fig¬ 
ures  with  skepticism.  Yet  there  is  one  record  of  a  giant  wave 
which,  because  of  the  method  of  measurement,  seems  to  be  ac¬ 
cepted  as  reliable. 

In  February  1933  the  U.S.S.  Kamcipo ,  while  proceeding  from 
Manila  to  San  Diego,  encountered  seven  days  of  stormy  weather. 
The  storm  was  part  of  a  weather  disturbance  that  extended  all 
the  way  from  Kamchatka  to  New  York  and  permitted  the  winds 
an  unbroken  fetch  of  thousands  of  miles.  During  the  height  of 


n6 


The  Restless  Sea 


the  storm  the  Ramapo  maintained  a  course  running  down  the 
wind  and  with  the  sea.  On  6  February  the  gale  reached  its 
fiercest  intensity.  Winds  of  68  knots  came  in  gusts  and  squalls, 
and  the  seas  reached  mountainous  height.  While  standing  watch 
on  the  bridge  during  the  early  hours  of  that  day,  one  of  the  offi¬ 
cers  of  the  Ramapo  saw,  in  the  moonlight,  a  great  sea  rising 
astern  to  a  level  above  an  iron  strap  on  the  crow's  nest  of  the 
mainmast.  The  Ramapo  was  on  even  keel  and  her  stern  was  in 
the  trough  of  the  sea.  These  circumstances  made  possible  an 
exact  line  of  sight  from  the  bridge  to  the  crest  of  the  wave,  and 
simple  mathematical  calculations  based  on  the  dimensions  of  the 
ship  gave  the  height  of  the  wave.  It  was  112  feet. 

W aves  have  taken  their  toll  of  shipping  and  of  human  life  on 
the  open  sea,  but  it  is  around  the  shorelines  of  the  world  that 
they  are  most  destructive.  Whatever  the  height  of  storm  waves  at 
sea,  there  is  abundant  evidence,  as  some  of  the  case  histories  that 
follow  will  show,  that  breaking  surf  and  the  upward-leaping 
water  masses  from  thundering  breakers  may  engulf  lighthouses, 
shatter  buildings,  and  hurl  stones  through  lighthouse  windows 
anywhere  from  100  to  300  feet  above  the  sea.  Before  the  power 
of  such  surf,  piers  and  breakwaters  and  other  shore  installations 
are  fragile  as  a  child’s  toys. 

Almost  every  coast  of  the  world  is  visited  periodically  by  vio¬ 
lent  storm  surf,  but  there  are  some  that  have  never  known  the 
sea  in  its  milder  moods.  ‘There  is  not  in  the  world  a  coast  more 
terrible  than  this!’  exclaimed  Lord  Bryce  of  Tierra  del  Fuego, 
where  the  breakers  roar  in  upon  the  coast  with  a  voice  that,  ac¬ 
cording  to  report,  can  be  heard  20  miles  inland  on  a  still  night. 
The  sight  of  such  a  coast,’  Darwin  had  written  in  his  diary,  ‘is 
enough  to  make  a  landsman  dream  for  a  week  about  death,  peril, 
and  shipwreck.’ 

Others  claim  that  the  Pacific  coast  of  the  United  States  from 
northern  California  to  the  Straits  of  Juan  de  Fuca  has  a  surf  as 
heavy  as  any  in  the  world.  But  it  seems  unlikely  that  any  coast 
is  visited  more  wrathfully  by  the  sea’s  waves  than  the  Shetlands 
and  the  Orkneys,  in  the  path  of  the  cyclonic  storms  that  pass 


Wind  and  Water 


117 


eastward  between  Iceland  and  the  British  Isles.  All  the  feeling 
and  the  fury  of  such  a  storm,  couched  almost  in  Conradian 
prose,  are  contained  in  the  usually  prosaic  British  Islands  Pilot: 

In  the  terrific  gales  which  usually  occur  four  or  five  times  in 
every  year  all  distinction  between  air  and  water  is  lost,  the  near¬ 
est  objects  are  obscured  by  spray,  and  everything  seems  enveloped 
in  a  thick  smoke;  upon  the  open  coast  the  sea  rises  at  once,  and 
striking  upon  the  rocky  shores  rises  in  foam  for  several  hundred 
feet  and  spreads  over  the  whole  country. 

The  sea,  however,  is  not  so  heavy  in  the  violent  gales  of  short 
continuance  as  when  an  ordinary  gale  has  been  blowing  for  many 
days;  the  whole  force  of  the  Atlantic  is  then  beating  against  the 
shores  of  the  Orkneys,  rocks  of  many  tons  in  weight  are  lifted 
from  their  beds,  and  the  roar  of  the  surge  may  be  heard  for 
twenty  miles;  the  breakers  rise  to  the  height  of  60  feet,  and  the 
broken  sea  on  the  North  Shoal,  which  lies  12  miles  northwest¬ 
ward  of  Costa  Head,  is  visible  at  Skail  and  Birsay. 

The  first  man  who  ever  measured  the  force  of  an  ocean  wave 
was  Thomas  Stevenson,  father  of  Robert  Louis.  Stevenson  de¬ 
veloped  the  instrument  known  as  a  wave  dynamometer  and  with 
it  studied  the  waves  that  battered  the  coast  of  his  native  Scot¬ 
land.  He  found  that  in  winter  gales  the  force  of  a  wave  might  be 
as  great  as  6000  pounds  to  the  square  foot.  Perhaps  it  was  waves 
of  this  strength  that  destroyed  the  breakwater  at  Wick  on  the 
coast  of  Scotland  in  a  December  storm  in  1872.  The  seaward  end 
of  the  Wick  breakwater  consisted  of  a  block  of  concrete  weigh¬ 
ing  more  than  800  tons,  bound  solidly  with  iron  rods  to  under¬ 
lying  blocks  of  stone.  During  the  height  of  this  winter  gale  the 
resident  engineer  watched  the  onslaught  of  the  waves  from  a 
point  on  the  cliff  above  the  breakwater.  Before  his  incredulous 
eyes,  the  block  of  concrete  was  lifted  up  and  swept  shoreward. 
After  the  storm  had  subsided  divers  investigated  the  wreckage. 
They  found  that  not  only  the  concrete  monolith  but  the  stones 
it  was  attached  to  had  been  carried  away.  The  waves  had  torn 
loose,  lifted,  and  bodily  moved  a  mass  weighing  not  less  than 
1350  tons,  or  2,700,000  pounds.  Five  years  later  it  became  clear 
that  this  feat  had  been  a  mere  dress  rehearsal,  for  the  new  pier, 


n8 


The  Restless  Sea 


weighing  about  2600  tons,  was  then  carried  away  in  another 
storm. 

A  list  of  the  perverse  and  freakish  doings  of  the  sea  can  easily 
be  compiled  from  the  records  of  the  keepers  of  lights  on  lonely 
ledges  at  sea,  or  on  rocky  headlands  exposed  to  the  full  strength 
of  storm  surf.  At  Unst,  the  most  northern  of  the  Shetland 
Islands,  a  door  in  the  lighthouse  was  broken  open  195  feet  above 
the  sea.  At  the  Bishop  Rock  Light,  on  the  English  Channel, 
a  bell  was  torn  away  from  its  attachment  100  feet  above  high 
water  during  a  winter  gale.  About  the  Bell  Rock  Light  on  the 
coast  of  Scotland  one  November  day  a  heavy  ground  swell  was 
running,  although  there  was  no  wind.  Suddenly  one  of  the  swells 
rose  about  the  tower,  mounted  to  the  gilded  ball  atop  the  lan¬ 
tern,  117  feet  above  the  rock,  and  tore  away  a  ladder  that  was 
attached  to  the  tower  86  feet  above  the  water.  There  have  been 
happenings  that,  to  some  minds,  are  tinged  with  the  super¬ 
natural,  like  that  at  the  Eddystone  Light  in  1840.  The  entrance 
door  of  the  tower  had  been  made  fast  by  strong  bolts,  as  usual. 
During  a  night  of  heavy  seas  the  door  was  broken  open  from 
within,  and  all  its  iron  bolts  and  hinges  were  torn  loose.  Engi¬ 
neers  say  that  such  a  thing  happens  as  a  result  of  pneumatic 
action — the  sudden  back  draught  created  by  the  recession  of  a 
heavy  wave  combined  with  an  abrupt  release  of  pressure  on  the 
outside  of  the  door. 

On  the  Atlantic  coast  of  the  United  States,  the  97-foot  tower 
on  Minot's  Ledge  in  Massachusetts  is  often  completely  envel¬ 
oped  by  masses  of  water  from  breaking  surf,  and  an  earlier  light 
on  this  ledge  was  swept  away  in  1851.  Then  there  is  the  often 
quoted  story  of  the  December  storm  at  Trinidad  Head  Light  on 
the  coast  of  northern  California.  As  the  keeper  watched  the 
storm  from  his  lantern  196  feet  above  high  water,  he  could  see 
the  near-by  Pilot  Rock  engulfed  again  and  again  by  waves  that 
swept  over  its  hundred-foot  crest.  Then  a  wave,  larger  than  the 
rest,  struck  the  cliffs  at  the  base  of  the  light.  It  seemed  to  rise 
in  a  solid  wall  of  water  to  the  level  of  the  lantern,  and  it  hurled

Along  a  rocky  coast,  the  waves  of  a  severe  storm  are  likely  to 
be  armed  with  stones  and  rock  fragments,  which  greatly  in¬ 
crease  their  destructive  power.  Once  a  rock  weighing  135  pounds 
was  hurled  high  above  the  lightkeeper’s  house  on  Tillamook 
Rock  on  the  coast  of  Oregon,  100  feet  above  sea  level.  In  falling, 
it  tore  a  20-foot  hole  through  the  roof.  The  same  day  showers  of 
smaller  rocks  broke  many  panes  of  glass  in  the  lantern,  132  feet 
above  the  sea.  The  most  amazing  of  such  stories  concerns  the 
lighthouse  at  Dunnet  Head,  which  stands  on  the  summit  of  a 
300-foot  cliff  at  the  southwestern  entrance  to  Pentland  Firth. 
The  windows  of  this  light  have  been  broken  repeatedly  by  stones 
swept  from  the  cliff  and  tossed  aloft  by  waves. 

For  millennia  beyond  computation,  the  sea’s  waves  have  bat¬ 
tered  the  coastlines  of  the  world  with  erosive  effect,  here  cutting 
back  a  cliff,  there  stripping  away  tons  of  sand  from  a  beach,  and 
yet  again,  in  a  reversal  of  their  destructiveness,  building  up  a  bar 
or  a  small  island.  Unlike  the  slow  geologic  changes  that  bring 
about  the  flooding  of  half  a  continent,  the  work  of  the  waves  is 
attuned  to  the  brief  span  of  human  life,  and  so  the  sculpturing 
of  the  continent’s  edge  is  something  each  of  us  can  see  for  our¬ 
selves. 

The  high  clay  cliff  of  Cape  Cod,  rising  at  Eastham  and  run¬ 
ning  north  until  it  is  lost  in  the  sand  dunes  near  Peaked  Hill,  is 
wearing  back  so  fast  that  half  of  the  ten  acres  which  the  Govern¬ 
ment  acquired  as  a  site  for  the  Highland  Light  has  disappeared, 
and  the  cliffs  are  said  to  be  receding  about  three  feet  a  year. 
Cape  Cod  is  not  old,  in  geologic  terms,  being  the  product  of  the 
glaciers  of  the  most  recent  Ice  Age,  but  apparently  the  waves 
have  cut  away,  since  its  formation,  a  strip  of  land  some  two  miles 
wide.  At  the  present  rate  of  erosion,  the  disappearance  of  the 
outer  cape  is  foredoomed;  it  will  presumably  occur  in  another 
4000  or  5000  years. 

The  sea’s  method  on  a  rocky  coast  is  to  wear  it  down  by 
grinding,  to  chisel  out  and  wrench  away  fragments  of  rock,  each 
of  which  becomes  a  tool  to  wear  away  the  cliff.  And  as  masses 
of  rock  are  undercut,  a  whole  huge  mass  will  fall  into  the  sea, 
there  to  be  ground  in  the  mill  of  the  surf  and  to  contribute 


120 


The  Restless  Sea 


more  weapons  for  the  attack.  On  a  rocky  shore  this  grinding  and 
polishing  of  rocks  and  fragments  of  rocks  goes  on  incessantly 
and  audibly,  for  the  breakers  on  such  a  coast  have  a  different 
sound  from  those  that  have  only  sand  to  work  with— a  deep- 
toned  mutter  and  rumble  not  easily  forgotten,  even  by  one  who 
strolls  casually  along  such  a  beach.  Few  people  have  heard  the 
sounds  of  the  surf  mill  practically  from  within  the  sea,  as  de¬ 
scribed  by  Henwood  after  his  visit  to  a  British  mine  extending 
out  under  the  ocean: 

When  standing  beneath  the  base  of  the  cliff,  and  in  that  part 
of  the  mine  where  but  nine  feet  of  rock  stood  between  us  and 
the  ocean,  the  heavy  roll  of  the  larger  boulders,  the  ceaseless 
grinding  of  the  pebbles,  the  fierce  thundering  of  the  billows,  with 
the  crackling  and  boiling  as  they  rebounded,  placed  a  tempest 
in  its  most  appalling  form  too  vividly  before  me  ever  to  be  for¬ 
gotten.  More  than  once  doubting  the  protection  of  our  rocky 
shield  we  retreated  in  affright;  and  it  was  only  after  repeated  trials 
that  we  had  confidence  to  pursue  our  investigations.* 

Great  Britain,  an  island,  has  always  been  conscious  of  that 
'powerful  marine  gnawing’  by  which  her  coasts  are  eaten  away. 
An  old  map  dated  1786  and  prepared  by  the  county  surveyor, 
John  Tuke,  gives  a  long  list  of  lost  towns  and  villages  on  the 
Holderness  Coast.  Among  them  are  notations  of  Hornsea  Bur¬ 
ton,  Hornsea  Beck,  and  Hartburn — 'washed  away  by  the  sea’; 
of  Ancient  Withernsea,  Hyde,  or  Hythe— 'lost  by  the  sea/  Many 
other  old  records  allow  comparison  of  present  shorelines  with 
former  ones  and  show  astonishing  annual  rates  of  cliff  erosion 
on  many  parts  of  the  coast— up  to  15  feet  at  Holderness,  19  feet 
between  Cromer  and  Mundesley,  and  15  to  45  feet  at  Southwold. 
The  configuration  of  the  coastline  of  Great  Britain/  one  of  her 
present  engineers  writes,  ‘is  not  the  same  for  two  consecutive 
days/ 

And  yet  we  owe  some  of  the  most  beautiful  and  interesting 
shoreline  scenery  to  the  sculpturing  effect  of  moving  water.  Sea 
caves  are  almost  literally  blasted  out  of  the  cliffs  by  waves,

which  pour  into  crevices  in  the  rocks  and  force  them  apart  by 
hydraulic  pressure.  Over  the  years  the  widening  of  fissures  and 
the  steady  removal  of  fine  rock  particles  in  infinite  number 
result  in  the  excavation  of  a  cave.  Within  such  a  cavern  the 
weight  of  incoming  water  and  the  strange  suctions  and  pressures 
caused  by  the  movements  of  water  in  an  enclosed  space  may 
continue  the  excavation  upward.  The  roofs  of  such  caves  (and 
of  overhanging  cliffs)  are  subjected  to  blows  like  those  from  a 
battering  ram  as  the  water  from  a  breaking  wave  is  hurled  up¬ 
ward,  most  of  the  energy  of  the  wave  passing  into  this  smaller 
mass  of  water.  Eventually  a  hole  is  torn  through  the  roof  of  the 
cave,  to  form  a  spouting  horn.  Or,  on  a  narrow  promontory, 
what  began  as  a  cave  may  be  cut  through  from  side  to  side,  so 
that  a  natural  bridge  is  formed.  Later,  after  years  of  erosion,  the 
arch  may  fall,  leaving  the  seaward  mass  of  rock  to  stand  alone- 
one  of  the  strange,  chimneylike  formations  known  as  a  stack. 

The  sea  waves  that  have  fixed  themselves  most  firmly  in  the 
human  imagination  are  the  so-called  'tidal  waves/  The  term  is 
popularly  applied  to  two  very  different  kinds  of  waves,  neither 
of  which  has  any  relation  to  the  tide.  One  is  a  seismic  sea  wave 
produced  by  undersea  earthquakes;  the  other  is  an  exceptionally 
vast  wind  or  storm  wave — an  immense  mass  of  water  driven  by 
winds  of  hurricane  force  far  above  the  normal  high-water  line. 

Most  of  the  seismic  sea  waves,  now  called  'tsunamis/  are  born 
in  the  deepest  trenches  of  the  ocean  floor.  The  Japanese,  Aleu¬ 
tian,  and  Atacama  trenches  have  each  produced  waves  that 
claimed  many  human  lives.  Such  a  trench  is,  by  its  very  nature, 
a  breeder  of  earthquakes,  being  a  place  of  disturbed  and  uneasy 
equilibrium,  of  buckling  and  warping  downward  of  the  sea  floor 
to  form  the  deepest  pits  of  all  the  earth’s  surface.  From  the  his¬ 
toric  records  of  the  ancients  down  to  the  modern  newspaper,  the 
writings  of  man  contain  frequent  mention  of  the  devastation  of 
coastal  settlements  by  these  great  waves  that  suddenly  rise  out 
of  the  sea.  One  of  the  earliest  of  record  rose  along  the  eastern 
shores  of  the  Mediterranean  in  a.d.  358,  passing  completely  over 
islands  and  low-lying  shores,  leaving  boats  on  the  housetops  of 
Alexandria,  and  drowning  thousands  of  people.  After  the  Lisbon 


122 


The  Restless  Sea 


earthquake  of  1755,  the  coast  at  Cadiz  was  visited  by  a  wave  said 
to  have  been  50  feet  higher  than  the  highest  tide.  This  came 
about  an  hour  after  the  earthquake.  The  waves  from  this  same 
disturbance  traveled  across  the  Atlantic  and  reached  the  West 
Indies  in  gV2  hours.  In  1868,  a  stretch  of  nearly  3000  miles  of  the 
western  coast  of  South  America  was  shaken  by  earthquakes. 
Shortly  after  the  most  violent  shocks,  the  sea  receded  from  the 
shore,  leaving  ships  that  had  been  anchored  in  40  feet  of  water 
stranded  in  mud;  then  the  water  returned  in  a  great  wave,  and 
boats  were  carried  a  quarter  of  a  mile  inland. 

This  ominous  withdrawal  of  the  sea  from  its  normal  stand  is 
often  the  first  warning  of  the  approach  of  seismic  sea  waves. 
Natives  on  the  beaches  of  Hawaii  on  the  first  of  April  1946  were 
alarmed  when  the  accustomed  voice  of  the  breakers  was  sud¬ 
denly  stilled,  leaving  a  strange  quiet.  They  could  not  know  that 
this  recession  of  the  waves  from  the  reefs  and  the  shallow  coastal 
waters  was  the  sea’s  response  to  an  earthquake  on  the  steep 
slopes  of  a  deep  trench  off  the  island  of  Unimak  in  the  Aleutian 
chain,  more  than  2000  miles  away;  or  that  in  a  matter  of  mo¬ 
ments  the  water  would  rise  rapidly,  as  though  the  tide  were 
coming  in  much  too  fast,  but  without  surf.  The  rise  carried  the 
ocean  waters  25  feet  or  more  above  the  normal  levels  of  the  tide. 
According  to  an  eyewitness  account: 

The  waves  of  the  tsunami  swept  toward  shore  with  steep  fronts 
and  great  turbulence  .  .  .  Between  crests  the  water  withdrew  from 
shore,  exposing  reefs,  coastal  mud-flats,  and  harbor  bottoms  for 
distances  up  to  500  feet  or  more  from  the  normal  strand-line.  The 
outflow  of  the  water  was  rapid  and  turbulent,  making  a  loud 
hissing,  roaring,  and  rattling  noise.  At  several  places  houses  were 
carried  out  to  sea,  and  in  some  areas  even  large  rocks  and  blocks 
of  concrete  were  carried  out  onto  the  reefs  .  .  .  People  and  their 
belongings  were  swept  to  sea,  some  being  rescued  hours  later  by 
boats  and  life  rafts  dropped  from  planes.* 

In  the  open  ocean  the  waves  produced  by  the  Aleutian  quake 
were  only  about  a  foot  or  two  high  and  would  not  be  noticed

from  vessels.  Their  length,  however,  was  enormous,  with  a  dis¬ 
tance  of  about  90  miles  between  succeeding  crests.  It  took  the 
waves  less  than  five  hours  to  reach  the  Hawaiian  chain,  2300 
miles  distant,  so  they  must  have  moved  at  an  average  speed  of 
about  470  miles  per  hour.  Along  eastern  Pacific  shores,  they 
were  recorded  as  far  into  the  Southern  Hemisphere  as  Valpa¬ 
raiso,  Chile,  the  distance  of  8066  miles  from  the  epicenter  being 
covered  by  the  waves  in  about  18  hours. 

This  particular  occurrence  of  seismic  sea  waves  had  one  result 
that  distinguished  it  from  all  its  predecessors.  It  set  people  to 
thinking  that  perhaps  we  now  know  enough  about  such  waves 
and  how  they  behave  that  a  warning  system  could  be  devised 
which  would  rob  them  of  the  terror  of  the  unexpected.  Seismolo¬ 
gists  and  specialists  on  waves  and  tides  co-operated,  and  now 
such  a  system  has  been  established  to  protect  the  Hawaiian 
Islands.  A  network  of  stations  equipped  with  special  instruments 
is  scattered  over  the  Pacific  from  Kodiak  to  Pago  Pago  and  from 
Balboa  to  Palau.  There  are  two  phases  of  the  warning  system. 
One  is  based  on  a  new  audible  alarm  at  seismograph  stations 
operated  by  the  United  States  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey,  which 
calls  instant  attention  to  the  fact  that  an  earthquake  has  oc¬ 
curred.  If  it  is  found  that  the  epicenter  of  the  quake  is  under 
the  ocean  and  so  might  produce  seismic  sea  waves,  a  warning  is 
sent  to  observers  at  selected  tide  stations  to  watch  their  gauges 
for  evidence  of  the  passage  of  the  racing  tsunamis.  (Even  a  very 
small  seismic  sea  wave  can  be  identified  by  its  peculiar  period, 
and  though  it  may  be  small  at  one  place,  it  may  reach  dangerous 
heights  at  another.)  When  seismologists  in  Honolulu  are  noti¬ 
fied  that  an  undersea  earthquake  has  occurred  and  that  its  waves 
have  actually  been  recorded  at  certain  stations,  they  can  calcu¬ 
late  when  the  waves  will  arrive  at  any  point  between  the  epicen¬ 
ter  of  the  quake  and  the  Hawaiian  Islands.  They  can  then  issue 
warnings  for  the  evacuation  of  beaches  and  waterfront  areas. 
And  so,  for  the  first  time  in  history,  there  is  an  organized  effort 
to  prevent  these  ominous  waves  from  racing  undetected  over  the 
empty  spaces  of  the  Pacific,  to  roar  up  suddenly  on  some  inhab¬ 
ited  shore.12

The  Restless  Sea 

The  storm  waves  that  sometimes  rise  over  low-lying  coast 
lands  in  hurricane  zones  belong  in  the  class  of  wind  waves,  but 
unlike  the  waves  of  ordinary  winds  and  storms,  they  are  accom¬ 
panied  by  a  rise  of  the  general  water  level,  called  a  storm  tide. 
The  rise  of  water  is  often  so  sudden  that  it  leaves  no  possibility 
of  escape.  Such  storm  waves  claim  about  three-fourths  of  the 
lives  lost  by  tropical  hurricanes.  The  most  notable  disasters  from 
storm  waves  in  the  United  States  have  been  those  at  Galveston, 
Texas,  on  8  September,  1900,  on  the  lower  Florida  Keys  on  2  and 
3  September,  1935,  and  the  catastrophic  rise  of  water  accompany¬ 
ing  the  New  England  hurricane  of  21  September,  1938.  The  most 
fearful  destruction  by  hurricane  waves  within  historic  time  oc¬ 
curred  in  the  Bay  of  Bengal  on  7  October,  1737 ,  when  20,000 
boats  were  destroyed  and  300,000  people  drowned.13 

There  are  other  great  waves,  usually  called  hollers/  that  peri¬ 
odically  rise  on  certain  coasts  and  batter  them  for  days  with  dam- 
agmg  surf.  These,  too,  are  wind  waves,  but  they  are  related  to 
changes  in  barometric  pressure  over  the  ocean,  perhaps  several 
thousand  miles  distant  from  the  beaches  on  which  the  waves 
eventually  arrive.  Low-pressure  areas— like  the  one  south  of  Ice¬ 
land— are  notorious  storm  breeders,  their  winds  lashing  the  sea 
into  great  waves.  After  the  waves  leave  the  storm  area  they  tend 
to  become  lower  and  longer  and  after  perhaps  thousands  of  miles 
of  travel  across  the  sea  they  become  transformed  into  the  undu¬ 
lations  known  as  a  ground  swell.  These  swells  are  so  regular  and 
so  low  that  often  they  are  unnoticed  as  they  pass  through  the 
short,  choppy,  new-formed  waves  of  other  areas.  But  when  a 
swell  approaches  a  coast  and  feels  beneath  it  the  gradually  shoal¬ 
ing  bottom,  it  begins  to  'peak  up’  into  a  high,  steep  wave;  within 
the  surf  zone  the  steepening  becomes  abruptly  accentuated,  a 
crest  forms,  breaks,  and  a  great  mass  of  water  plunges  downward. 

Winter  swell  on  the  west  coast  of  North  America  is  the  prod¬ 
uct  of  storms  that  travel  south  of  the  Aleutians  into  the  Gulf  of 
Alaska.  Swell  reaching  this  same  coast  during  the  summer  has 
been  traced  back  to  its  origin  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere  belt 
of  the  ‘roaring  forties/  several  thousand  miles  south  of  the 
equator.  Because  of  the  direction  of  the  prevailing  winds,  the 


Wind  and  Water  125 

American  east  coast  and  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  do  not  receive  the 
swell  from  far  distant  storms. 

The  coast  of  Morocco  has  always  been  particularly  at  the 
mercy  of  swell,  for  there  is  no  protected  harbor  from  the  Strait 
of  Gibraltar  southward  for  some  500  miles.  The  rollers  that  visit 
the  Atlantic  islands  of  Ascension,  St.  Helena,  South  Trinidad, 
and  Fernando  de  Noronha  are  historic.  Apparently  the  same  sort 
of  waves  occur  on  the  South  American  coast  near  Rio  de  Janeiro, 
where  they  are  known  as  resacas;  others  of  kindred  nature,  hav¬ 
ing  run  their  course  from  storms  in  the  west-wind  belt  of  the 
South  Pacific,  attack  the  shores  of  the  Paumotos  Islands;  still 
others  have  been  responsible  for  the  well-known  ‘surf  days’  that 
plague  the  Pacific  coast  of  South  America.  According  to  Robert 
Cushman  Murphy,  it  was  formerly  the  custom  of  shipmasters  in 
the  guano  trade  to  demand  a  special  allowance  for  a  certain 
number  of  days  during  which  the  loading  of  their  vessels  would 
be  interrupted  by  the  swell.  On  such  surf  days  ‘mighty  rollers 
come  pouring  over  the  sea  wall,  and  have  been  known  to  carry 
away  forty-ton  freight  cars,  to  uproot  concrete  piers,  and  to  twist 
iron  rails  like  wire/ 

The  slow  progression  of  swell  from  its  place  of  origin  made  it 
possible  for  the  Moroccan  Protectorate  to  establish  a  service  for 
the  prediction  of  the  state  of  the  sea.  This  was  done  in  1921, 
after  long  and  troublesome  experience  with  wrecked  vessels  and 
wharves.  Daily  telegraphic  reports  of  the  condition  of  the  sea 
give  advance  notice  of  troublesome  surf  days.  Warned  of  the 
approach  of  swells,  ships  in  port  may  seek  safety  in  the  open  sea. 
Before  this  service  was  established,  the  port  of  Casablanca  had 
once  been  paralyzed  for  seven  months,  and  St.  Helena  had  seen 
the  wreckage  of  practically  all  the  ships  in  her  harbor  on  one  or 
more  occasions.  Modern  wave-recording  instruments  like  those 
now  being  tested  in  England  and  the  United  States  will  soon 
provide  even  greater  security  for  all  such  shores. 

It  is  always  the  unseen  that  most  deeply  stirs  our  imagination, 
and  so  it  is  with  waves.  The  largest  and  most  awe-inspiring 
waves  of  the  ocean  are  invisible;  they  move  on  their  mysterious 
courses  far  down  in  the  hidden  depths  of  the  sea,  rolling  ponder-

The  Restless  Sea 

ously  and  unceasingly.  For  many  years  it  was  known  that  the 
vessels  of  Arctic  expeditions  often  became  almost  trapped  and 
made  headway  only  with  difficulty  in  what  was  called  ‘dead 
water’— now  recognized  as  internal  waves  at  the  boundary  be¬ 
tween  a  thin  surface  layer  of  fresh  water  and  the  underlying  salt 
water.  In  the  early  1900’s  several  Scandinavian  hydrographers 
called  attention  to  the  existence  of  submarine  waves,  but  another 
generation  was  to  elapse  before  science  had  the  instruments  to 
study  them  thoroughly. 

Now,  even  though  mystery  still  surrounds  the  causes  of  these 
great  waves  that  rise  and  fall,  far  below  the  surface,  their  ocean¬ 
wide  occurrence  is  well  established.  Down  in  deep  water  they 
toss  submarines  about,  just  as  their  surface  counterparts  set  ships 
to  rolling.  They  seem  to  break  against  the  Gulf  Stream  and 
other  strong  currents  in  a  deep-sea  version  of  the  dramatic  meet¬ 
ing  of  surface  waves  and  opposing  tidal  currents.  Probably  in¬ 
ternal  waves  occur  wherever  there  is  a  boundary  between  layers 
of  dissimilar  water,  just  as  the  waves  we  see  occur  at  the  bound¬ 
ary  between  air  and  sea.  But  these  are  waves  such  as  never  moved 
at  the  surface  of  the  ocean.  The  water  masses  involved  are  un¬ 
thinkably  great,  some  of  the  waves  being  as  high  as  300  feet. 

Of  their  effect  on  fishes  and  other  life  of  the  deep  sea  we  have 
only  the  faintest  conception.  Swedish  scientists  say  that  the  her¬ 
ring  are  carried  or  drawn  into  some  of  the  fiords  of  Sweden  when 
the  deep  internal  waves  roll  over  the  submerged  sills  and  into  the 
fiords.  In  the  open  ocean,  we  know  that  the  boundary  between 
water  masses  of  different  temperatures  or  salinities  is  often  a  bar¬ 
rier  that  may  not  be  passed  by  living  creatures,  delicately  ad¬ 
justed  to  certain  conditions.  Do  these  creatures  themselves  then 
move  up  and  down  with  the  roll  of  the  deep  waves?  And  what 
happens  to  the  bottom  fauna  of  the  continental  slope,  adjusted, 
it  may  be,  to  water  of  unchanging  warmth?  What  is  their  fate 
when  the  waves  move  in  from  a  region  of  arctic  cold,  rolling  like 
a  storm  surf  against  those  deep,  dark  slopes?  At  present  we  do 
not  know.  We  can  only  sense  that  in  the  deep  and  turbulent  re¬ 
cesses  of  the  sea  are  hidden  mysteries  far  greater  than  any  we 
have  solved.

A 

1  n.S  the  Albatross  III  groped  through  fog  over  Georges  Bank 
all  of  one  week  in  the  midsummer  of  1949,  those  of  us  aboard 
had  a  personal  demonstration  of  the  power  of  a  great  ocean 
current.  There  was  never  less  than  a  hundred  miles  of  cold 
Atlantic  water  between  us  and  the  Gulf  Stream,  but  the  winds 
blew  persistently  from  the  south  and  the  warm  breath  of  the 
Stream  rolled  over  the  Bank.  The  combination  of  warm  air  and 
cold  water  spelled  unending  fog.  Day  after  day  the  Albatross 
moved  in  a  small  circular  room,  whose  walls  were  soft  gray 
curtains  and  whose  floor  had  a  glassy  smoothness.  Sometimes  a 
petrel  flew,  with  swallow-like  flutterings,  across  this  room,  en¬ 
tering  and  leaving  it  by  passing  through  its  walls  as  if  by  sorcery. 
Evenings,  the  sun,  before  it  set,  was  a  pale  silver  disc  hung  in  the 
ship’s  rigging,  the  drifting  streamers  of  fog  picking  up  a  diffused 
radiance  and  creating  a  scene  that  set  us  to  searching  our  mem¬ 
ories  for  quotations  from  Coleridge.  The  sense  of  a  powerful 
presence  felt  but  not  seen,  its  nearness  made  manifest  but  never 
revealed,  was  infinitely  more  dramatic  than  a  direct  encounter 
with  the  current.

The  Restless  Sea 


The  permanent  currents  of  the  ocean  are,  in  a  way,  the  most 
majestic  of  her  phenomena.  Reflecting  upon  them,  our  minds 
are  at  once  taken  out  from  the  earth  so  that  we  can  regard,  as 
from  another  planet,  the  spinning  of  the  globe,  the  winds  that 
deeply  trouble  its  surface  or  gently  encompass  it,  and  the  influ¬ 
ence  of  the  sun  and  the  moon.  For  all  these  cosmic  forces  are 
closely  linked  with  the  great  currents  of  the  ocean,  earning  for 
them  the  adjective  I  like  best  of  all  those  applied  to  them— the 
planetary  currents. 

Since  the  world  began,  the  ocean  currents  have  undoubtedly 
changed  their  courses  many  times  (we  know,  for  example,  that 
the  Gulf  Stream  is  no  more  than  about  60  million  years  old); 
but  it  would  be  a  bold  writer  who  would  try  to  describe  their 
pattern  in  the  Cambrian  period,  for  example,  or  in  the  Devo¬ 
nian,  or  in  the  Jurassic.  So  far  as  the  brief  period  of  human 
history  is  concerned,  however,  it  is  most  unlikely  that  there  has 
been  any  important  change  in  the  major  patterns  of  oceanic 
circulation,  and  the  first  thing  that  impresses  us  about  the  cur¬ 
rents  is  their  permanence.  This  is  not  surprising,  for  the  forces 
that  produce  the  currents  show  little  disposition  to  change  ma¬ 
terially  over  the  eons  of  earthly  time.  The  primary  driving  power 
is  supplied  by  the  winds;  the  modifying  influences  are  the  sun, 
the  revolving  of  the  earth  ever  toward  the  east,  and  the  obstruct¬ 
ing  masses  of  the  continents. 

The  surface  of  the  sea  is  unequally  heated  by  the  sun;  as  the 
water  is  warmed  it  expands  and  becomes  lighter,  while  the  cold 
water  becomes  heavier  and  more  dense.  Probably  a  slow  ex¬ 
change  of  polar  and  equatorial  waters  is  brought  about  by  these 
differences,  the  heated  water  of  the  tropics  moving  poleward  in 
the  upper  layers,  and  polar  water  creeping  toward  the  equator 
along  the  floor  of  the  sea.  But  these  movements  are  obscured  and 
largely  lost  in  the  far  greater  sweep  of  the  wind-driven  currents. 
The  steadiest  winds  are  the  trades,  blowing  diagonally  toward 
the  equator  from  the  northeast  and  southeast.  It  is  the  trades 
that  drive  the  equatorial  currents  around  the  globe.  On  wind  and 
water  alike,  as  on  all  that  moves,  be  it  a  ship,  a  bullet,  or  a  bird, 
the  spinning  earth  exerts  a  deflecting  force,  turning  all  moving

objects  to  the  right  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  and  to  the  left 
in  the  Southern.  Through  the  combined  action  of  these  and 
other  forces,  the  resulting  current  patterns  are  slowly  circulating 
eddies,  turning  to  the  right,  or  clockwise,  in  the  northern  oceans, 
and  to  the  left,  or  counterclockwise,  in  the  southern. 

There  are  exceptions,  and  the  Indian  Ocean,  which  seems 
never  to  be  quite  like  the  others,  is  an  important  one.  Ruled  by 
the  capricious  monsoons,  its  currents  shift  with  the  seasons. 
North  of  the  equator,  the  direction  of  flow  of  immense  masses 
of  water  may  be  either  eastward  or  westward,  depending  on 
which  of  the  monsoons  is  blowing.  In  the  southern  part  of  this 
ocean  a  fairly  typical  counterclockwise  pattern  exists:  westward 
under  the  equator,  south  along  the  African  coast,  east  to  Aus¬ 
tralia  on  the  westerly  winds,  northward  by  devious  and  season¬ 
ally  shifting  paths,  here  giving  up  water  to  the  Pacific  and  there 
receiving  contributions  from  it. 

The  Antarctic  Ocean,  being  merely  a  continuous  band  of 
water  encircling  the  globe,  is  another  exception  to  the  typical 
current  pattern.  Its  waters  are  driven  constantly  into  the  east 
and  the  northeast  by  winds  from  the  west  and  the  southwest, 
and  the  currents  are  given  speed  by  the  quantities  of  fresh  water 
pouring  in  from  melting  ice.  It  is  not  a  closed  circulation;  water 
is  given  off,  in  surface  currents  and  by  deep  paths,  to  the  adjacent 
oceans,  and  in  return  other  water  is  received  from  them. 

It  is  in  the  Atlantic  and  Pacific  that  we  see  most  clearly  the 
interplay  of  cosmic  forces  producing  the  planetary  currents. 

Perhaps  because  of  the  long  centuries  over  which  the  Atlantic 
has  been  crossed  and  recrossed  by  trade  routes,  its  currents  have 
been  longest  known  to  seafaring  men  and  best  studied  by  ocean¬ 
ographers.  The  strongly  running  Equatorial  Currents  were  fa¬ 
miliar  to  generations  of  seamen  in  the  days  of  sail.  So  determined 
was  their  set  to  westward  that  vessels  intending  to  pass  down 
into  the  South  Atlantic  could  make  no  headway  unless  they 
had  gained  the  necessary  easting  in  the  region  of  the  southeast 
trades.  Ponce  de  Leon’s  three  ships,  sailing  south  from  Cape 
Canaveral  to  Tortugas  in  1513,  sometimes  were  unable  to  stem 
the  Gulf  Stream,  and  ‘although  they  had  great  wind,  they  could

not  proceed  forward,  but  backward/  A  few  years  later  Spanish 
shipmasters  learned  to  take  advantage  of  the  currents,  sailing 
westward  in  the  Equatorial  Current,  but  returning  home  via  the 

Gulf  Stream  as  far  as  Cape  Hatteras,  whence  they  launched  out 
into  the  open  Atlantic. 

The  first  chart  of  the  Gulf  Stream  was  prepared  about  1769 
under  the  direction  of  Benjamin  Franklin  while  he  was  Deputy 
Postmaster  General  of  the  Colonies.  The  Board  of  Customs  in 
Boston  had  complained  that  the  mail  packets  coming  from  Eng¬ 
land  took  two  weeks  longer  to  make  the  westward  crossing  than 
did  the  Rhode  Island  merchant  ships.  Franklin,  perplexed,  took 
the  problem  to  a  Nantucket  sea  captain,  Timothy  Folger,  who 
told  him  this  might  very  well  be  true  because  the  Rhode  Island 
captains  were  well  acquainted  with  the  Gulf  Stream  and  avoided 
it  on  the  westward  crossing,  whereas  the  English  captains  were 
not.  Folger  and  other  Nantucket  whalers  were  personally  fa¬ 
miliar  with  the  Stream  because,  he  explained, 

in  our  pursuit  of  whales,  which  keep  to  the  sides  of  it  but  are  not 
met  within  it,  we  run  along  the  side  and  frequently  cross  it  to 
c  ange  our  side,  and  in  crossing  it  have  sometimes  met  and  spoke 
with  those  packets  who  were  in  the  middle  of  it  and  stemming  it. 
We  have  informed  them  that  they  were  stemming  a  current  that 
was  against  them  to  the  value  of  three  miles  an  hour  and  advised 
them  to  cross  it,  but  they  were  too  wise  to  be  counselled  by  simple 
American  fishermen.* 

Franklin,  thinking  it  was  a  pity  no  notice  was  taken  of  this 
current  upon  the  charts/  asked  Folger  to  mark  it  out  for  him. 
The  course  of  the  Gulf  Stream  was  then  engraved  on  an  old 
chart  of  the  Atlantic  and  sent  by  Franklin  to  Falmouth,  Eng¬ 
land,  for  the  captains  of  the  packets,  who  slighted  it,  however/ 

It  was  later  printed  in  France  and  after  the  Revolution  was  pub¬ 
lished  in  the  Transactions  of  the  American  Philosophical  So¬ 
ciety.  The  thriftiness  of  the  Philosophical  Society  editors  led 
them  to  combine  in  one  plate  Franklin's  chart  and  a  wholly 
separate  figure  intended  to  illustrate  a  paper  by  John  Gilpin  on 

*  From  Am.  Phil.  Soc.  Trans.,  vol.  2,  1786. 


Wind,  Sun,  and  the  Spinning  of  the  Earth  131 

the  ‘Annual  Migrations  of  the  Herring.’  Some  later  historians 
have  erroneously  assumed  a  connection  between  Franklin’s  con¬ 
ception  of  the  Gulf  Stream  and  the  insert  in  the  upper  left 
corner  (see  back  end  paper). 

Were  it  not  for  the  deflecting  barrier  of  the  Panamanian  isth¬ 
mus,  the  North  Equatorial  Current  would  cross  into  the  Pacific, 
as  indeed  it  must  have  done  through  the  many  geologic  ages 
when  the  continents  of  North  and  South  America  were  sepa¬ 
rated.  After  the  Panama  ridge  was  formed  in  the  late  Cretaceous 
period,  the  current  was  doubled  back  to  the  northeast  to  re-enter 
the  Atlantic  as  the  Gulf  Stream.  From  the  Yucatan  Channel 
eastward  through  the  Florida  Straits  the  Stream  attains  impres¬ 
sive  proportions.  If  thought  of  in  the  time-honored  conception 
of  a  ‘river’  in  the  sea,  its  width  from  bank  to  bank  is  95  miles. 
It  is  a  mile  deep  from  surface  to  river  bed.  It  flows  with  a  velocity 
of  nearly  three  knots  and  its  volume  is  that  of  several  hundred 
Mississippis. 

Even  in  these  days  of  Diesel  power,  the  coastwise  shipping  off 
southern  Florida  shows  a  wholesome  respect  for  the  Gulf 
Stream.  Almost  any  day,  if  you  are  out  in  a  small  boat  below 
Miami,  you  can  see  the  big  freighters  and  tankers  moving  south 
in  a  course  that  seems  surprisingly  close  to  the  Keys.  Landward 
is  the  almost  unbroken  wall  of  submerged  reefs  where  the  big 
niggerhead  corals  send  their  solid  bulks  up  to  within  a  fathom 
or  two  of  the  surface.  To  seaward  is  the  Gulf  Stream,  and  while 
the  big  boats  could  fight  their  way  south  against  it,  they  would 
consume  much  time  and  fuel  in  doing  so.  Therefore  they  pick 
their  way  with  care  between  the  reefs  and  the  Stream. 

The  energy  of  the  Stream  off  southern  Florida  probably  re¬ 
sults  from  the  fact  that  here  it  is  actually  flowing  downhill. 
Strong  easterly  winds  pile  up  so  much  surface  water  in  the  nar¬ 
row  Yucatan  Channel  and  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  that  the  sea 
level  there  is  higher  than  in  the  open  Atlantic.  At  Cedar  Keys, 
on  the  Gulf  coast  of  Florida,  the  level  of  the  sea  is  19  centimeters 
(about  7V2  inches)  higher  than  at  St.  Augustine.  There  is  further 
unevenness  of  level  within  the  current  itself.  The  lighter  water 
is  deflected  by  the  earth’s  rotation  toward  the  right  side  of  the

current,  so  that  within  the  Gulf  Stream  the  sea  surface  actually 
slopes  upward  toward  the  right.  Along  the  coast  of  Cuba,  the 
ocean  is  about  18  inches  higher  than  along  the  mainland,  thus 
upsetting  completely  our  notions  that  'sea  level’  is  a  literal  ex¬ 
pression. 

Northward,  the  Stream  follows  the  contours  of  the  continental 
slope  to  the  offing  of  Cape  Hatteras,  whence  it  turns  more  to 
seaward,  deserting  the  sunken  edge  of  the  land.  But  it  has  left  its 
impress  on  the  continent.  The  four  beautifully  sculptured  capes 
of  the  southern  Atlantic  coast— Canaveral,  Fear,  Lookout,  Hat¬ 
teras— apparently  have  been  molded  by  powerful  eddies  set  up 
by  the  passage  of  the  Stream.  Each  is  a  cusp  projecting  seaward; 
between  each  pair  of  capes  the  beach  runs  in  a  long  curving  arc 
—the  expression  of  the  rhythmically  swirling  waters  of  the  Gulf 
Stream  eddies. 

Beyond  Hatteras,  the  Stream  leaves  the  shelf,  turning  north¬ 
eastward,  as  a  narrow,  meandering  current,  always  sharply  sepa¬ 
rated  from  the  water  on  either  side.  Off  the  'tail’  of  the  Grand 
Banks  the  line  is  most  sharply  drawn  between  the  cold,  bottle- 
green  arctic  water  of  the  Labrador  Current  and  the  warm  indigo 
blue  of  the  Stream.  In  winter  the  temperature  change  across  the 
current  boundary  is  so  abrupt  that  as  a  ship  crosses  into  the  Gulf- 
Stream  her  bow  may  be  momentarily  in  water  20°  warmer  than 
that  at  her  stern,  as  though  the  'cold  wall’  were  a  solid  barrier 
separating  the  two  water  masses.  One  of  the  densest  fog  banks 
in  the  world  lies  in  this  region  over  the  cold  water  of  the  Labra¬ 
dor  Current — a  thick,  blanketing  whiteness  that  is  the  atmos¬ 
pheric  response  to  the  Gulf  Stream’s  invasion  of  the  cold  north¬ 
ern  seas. 

Where  the  Stream  feels  the  rise  of  the  ocean  floor  known  as 
the  'tail’  of  the  Grand  Banks,  it  bends  eastward  and  begins  to 
spread  out  into  many  complexly  curving  tongues.  Probably  the 
force  of  the  arctic  water,  the  water  that  has  come  down  from 
Baffin  Bay  and  Greenland,  freighting  its  icebergs,  helps  push  the 
Stream  to  the  east— that,  and  the  deflecting  force  of  the  earth’s 
rotation,  always  turning  the  currents  to  the  right.  The  Labrador 
Current  itself  (being  a  southward-moving  current)  is  turned  in 


Wind,  Sun,  and  the  Spinning  of  the  Earth  135 

toward  the  mainland.  The  next  time  you  wonder  why  the  water 
is  so  cold  at  certain  coastal  resorts  of  the  eastern  United  States, 
remember  that  the  water  of  the  Labrador  Current  is  between 
you  and  the  Gulf  Stream. 

Passing  across  the  Atlantic,  the  Stream  becomes  less  a  current 
than  a  drift  of  water,  fanning  out  in  three  main  directions: 
southward  into  the  Sargasso;  northward  into  the  Norwegian  Sea, 
where  it  forms  eddies  and  deep  vortices;  eastward  to  warm  the 
coast  of  Europe  (some  of  it  even  to  pass  into  the  Mediterranean) 
and  thence  as  the  Canary  Current  to  rejoin  the  Equatorial  Cur¬ 
rent  and  close  the  circuit.14 

The  Atlantic  currents  of  the  Southern  Hemisphere  are  practi¬ 
cally  a  mirror  image  of  those  of  the  Northern.  The  great  spiral 
moves  counterclockwise— west,  south,  east,  north.  Here  the  dom¬ 
inant  current  is  in  the  eastern  instead  of  the  western  part  of  the 
ocean.  It  is  the  Benguela  Current,  a  river  of  cold  water  moving 
northward  along  the  west  coast  of  Africa.  The  South  Equatorial 
Current,  in  mid-ocean  a  powerful  stream  (the  Challenger  scien¬ 
tists  said  it  poured  past  St.  Paul's  Rocks  like  a  millrace)  loses  a 
substantial  part  of  its  waters  to  the  North  Atlantic  off  the  coast 
of  South  America — about  6  million  cubic  meters  a  second.  The 
remainder  becomes  the  Brazil  Current,  which  circles  south  and 
then  turns  east  as  the  South  Atlantic  or  Antarctic  Current.  The 
whole  is  a  system  of  shallow  water  movements,  involving 
throughout  much  of  its  course  not  more  than  the  upper  hundred 
fathoms. 

The  North  Equatorial  Current  of  the  Pacific  is  the  longest 
westerly  running  current  on  earth,  with  nothing  to  deflect  it  in 
its  9000-mile  course  from  Panama  to  the  Philippines.  There, 
meeting  the  barrier  of  the  islands,  most  of  it  swings  northward 
as  the  Japan  Current — Asia's  counterpart  of  the  Gulf  Stream. 
A  small  part  persists  on  its  westward  course,  feeling  its  way  amid 
the  labyrinth  of  Asiatic  islands;  part  turns  upon  itself  and 
streams  back  along  the  equator  as  the  Equatorial  Countercur¬ 
rent.  The  Japan  Current — called  Kuroshio  or  Black  Current  be¬ 
cause  of  the  deep,  indigo  blue  of  its  waters — rolls  northward 
along  the  continental  shelf  off  eastern  Asia,  until  it  is  driven 


The  Restless  Sea 


136 

away  from  the  continent  by  a  mass  of  icy  water — the  Oyashio — 
that  pours  out  of  the  Sea  of  Okhotsk  and  Bering  Sea.  The 
Japan  Current  and  Oyashio  meet  in  a  region  of  fog  and  tem¬ 
pestuous  winds,  as,  in  the  North  Atlantic,  the  meeting  of  the 
Gulf  Stream  and  the  Labrador  Current  is  marked  with  fog. 
Drifting  toward  America,  the  Japan  Current  forms  the  northern 
wall  of  the  great  North  Pacific  eddy.  Its  warm  waters  become 
chilled  with  infusions  of  cold  polar  water  from  Oyashio,  the 
Aleutians,  and  Alaska.  When  it  reaches  the  mainland  of  Amer¬ 
ica  it  is  a  cool  current,  moving  southward  along  the  coast  of 
California.  There  it  is  further  cooled  by  updrafts  of  deep  water 
and  has  much  to  do  with  the  temperate  summer  climate  of  the 
American  west  coast.  Off  Lower  California  it  rejoins  the  North 
Equatorial  Current. 

What  with  all  the  immensity  of  space  in  the  South  Pacific,  we 
should  expect  to  find  here  the  most  powerfully  impressive  of  all 
ocean  currents,  but  this  does  not  seem  to  be  true.  The  South 
Equatorial  Current  has  its  course  so  frequently  interrupted  by 
islands,  which  are  forever  deflecting  streams  of  its  water  into  the 
central  basin,  that  by  the  time  it  approaches  Asia  it  is,  during 
most  seasons,  a  comparatively  feeble  current,  lost  in  a  confused 
and  ill-defined  pattern  around  the  East  Indies  and  Australia.15 
The  West  Wind  Drift  or  Antarctic  Current — the  poleward  arc 
of  the  spiral— is  born  of  the  strongest  winds  in  the  world,  roaring 
across  stretches  of  ocean  almost  unbroken  by  land.  The  details 
of  this,  as  of  most  of  the  currents  of  the  South  Pacific,  are  but 
imperfectly  known.  Only  one  has  been  thoroughly  studied — the 
Humboldt — and  this  has  so  direct  an  effect  on  human  affairs  that 
it  overshadows  all  others. 

The  Humboldt  Current,  sometimes  called  the  Peru,  flows 
northward  along  the  west  coast  of  South  America,  carrying 
waters  almost  as  cold  as  the  Antarctic  from  which  it  comes.  But 
its  chill  is  actually  that  of  the  deep  ocean,  for  the  current  is 
reinforced  by  almost  continuous  upwelling  from  lower  oceanic 
layers.  It  is  because  of  the  Humboldt  that  penguins  live  almost 
under  the  equator,  on  the  Galapagos  Islands.  In  these  cold 
waters,  rich  in  minerals,  there  is  an  abundance  of  sea  life  per- 


Wind,  Sun,  and  the  Spinning  of  the  Earth  137 

haps  unparalleled  anywhere  else  in  the  world.  The  direct  har¬ 
vesters  of  this  sea  life  are  not  men,  but  millions  of  sea  birds. 
From  the  sun-baked  accumulations  of  guano  that  whiten  the 
coastal  cliffs  and  islands,  the  South  Americans  obtain,  at  second 
hand,  the  wealth  of  the  Humboldt  Current. 

Robert  E.  Coker,  who  studied  the  Peruvian  guano  industry 
at  the  request  of  that  government,  gives  a  vivid  picture  of  the 
life  of  the  Humboldt.  He  writes  of 

.  .  .  immense  schools  of  small  fishes,  the  anchobetas,  which  are 
followed  by  numbers  of  bonitos  and  other  fishes  and  by  sea  lions, 
while  at  the  same  time  they  are  preyed  upon  by  the  flocks  of 
cormorants,  pelicans,  gannets,  and  other  abundant  sea  birds  .  .  . 
The  long  files  of  pelicans,  the  low-moving  black  clouds  of  cor¬ 
morants,  or  the  rainstorms  of  plunging  gannets  probably  cannot 
be  equaled  in  any  other  part  of  the  world.  The  birds  feed  chiefly, 
almost  exclusively,  upon  the  anchobetas.  The  anchobeta,  then,  is 
not  only  .  .  .  the  food  of  the  larger  fishes,  but,  as  the  food  of  the 
birds,  it  is  the  source  from  which  is  derived  each  year  probably 
a  score  of  thousands  of  tons  of  high-grade  bird  guano.* 

Dr.  Coker  estimated  the  annual  consumption  of  fish  by  the 
guano-producing  birds  of  Peru  as  equal  to  a  fourth  of  the  total 
production  of  all  United  States  fisheries.  Because  of  this  diet, 
which  links  the  birds  with  all  the  minerals  of  the  sea,  their  excre¬ 
ment  is  the  most  valuable  and  efficient  fertilizer  in  the  world. 

Leaving  the  coast  of  South  America  at  about  the  latitude  of 
Cape  Blanco,  the  Humboldt  Current  turns  westward  into  the 
Pacific,  carrying  its  cool  waters  almost  to  the  equator.  About  the

with  lines  of  froth,  a  confused  turbulence  and  boiling,  and  even 
sounds  like  distant  breakers  accompany  the  displacement  of  the 
surface  layers  by  deep  water.  As  visible  evidence  of  the  upward 
movement  of  the  water  masses,  some  of  the  creatures  that  in¬ 
habit  the  deeper  places  of  the  sea  may  be  carried  up  bodily  into 
the  surface,  there  to  set  off  orgies  of  devouring  and  being  de¬ 
voured  such  as  Robert  Cushman  Murphy  witnessed  one  night  off 
the  coast  of  Colombia  from  the  schooner  A skoy.  The  night  had 
been  still  and  dark,  but  the  behavior  of  the  surface  made  it  clear 
that  deep  water  was  rising  and  that  some  sort  of  conflict  was  in 
progress  among  opposing  water  masses  far  below  the  ship.  All 
about  the  schooner  small,  steep  waves  leaped  into  being  and  dis¬ 
solved  in  foaming  whitecaps,  pricked  with  the  blue  fire  of  lumi¬ 
nescent  organisms.  Suddenly, 

On  either  side,  and  at  a  bafflingly  uncertain  distance  from  the 
ship,  a  dark  line,  like  a  wall  of  advancing  water,  seemed  to  be 
closing  in  upon  us  .  .  .  We  could  hear  the  splash  and  murmur  of 
a  troubled  surface  close  by  .  .  .  Presently  we  could  see  a  gleam 
of  foam  sprinkled  with  points  of  luminescence  on  the  slowly  ap¬ 
proaching  swell  or  head  to  the  left.  Vague  and  unfounded  thoughts 
of  marine  earthquake  bores  occurred  to  Fallon  and  me  together, 
and  we  felt  peculiarly  helpless  with  a  dismantled  engine  and  no 
breeze  to  make  the  craft  answer  her  helm.  The  dreamlike  slow¬ 
ness  of  all  that  was  going  on,  moreover,  gave  me  a  feeling  that  I 
had  not  yet  fully  shaken  off  the  bonds  of  three  hours’  slumber. 

However,  when  the  dark,  white-outlined  menace  reached  us, 
it  proved  to  be  nothing  more  than  a  field  of  the  dancing  water, 
tossing  its  little  peaks  a  mere  foot  or  so  into  the  air  and  beating 
a  tattoo  on  the  steel  flanks  of  ‘Askoy’  .  .  . 

Presently  a  sharp  hissing  sound,  different  in  character  from  the 
bursting  of  small  waves,  came  out  of  the  darkness  to  starboard, 
and  this  was  followed  by  strange  sighings  and  puffings  .  .  .  The 
puffers  were  blackfish,  many  scores,  or  perhaps  hundreds  of  them, 
rolling  and  lumbering  along  and  diving  to  pass  beneath  ‘Askoy’ 
shortly  before  they  reached  her  bilge  ...  We  could  hear  the 
bacchanalian  clamor  of  their  rumblings  and  belchings.  In  the 
long  beam  of  the  searchlight,  the  hissing  proved  to  come  from 
the  jumping  of  small  fishes.  In  all  directions  as  far  as  the  light 


Wind,  Sun,  and  the  Spinning  of  the  Earth  139 

carried,  they  were  shooting  into  the  air  and  pouring  down  like 
hail  .  .  . 

The  surface  was  seething,  boiling  with  life,  much  of  which  was 
de  profundis.  Larvae  of  clawless  lobsters,  tinted  jellyfish,  nurse 
chains  of  salps,  small  herringlike  fishes,  a  silvery  hatchetfish  with 
its  face  bitten  off,  rudder  fishes,  hanging  head  downward,  lumi¬ 
nous  lantern-fishes  with  shining  light  pores,  red  and  purple  swim¬ 
ming  crabs,  other  creatures  which  we  could  not  name  at  sight 
and  much  that  was  too  small  even  to  see  distinctly  . .  . 

A  general  holocaust  was  in  progress.  The  little  fishes  were  eat¬ 
ing  invertebrates  or  straining  out  the  plankton;  the  squids  were 
pursuing  and  capturing  fish  of  various  sizes;  and  the  blackfish 
were  no  doubt  enjoying  the  squids  .  .  . 

As  the  night  wore  on,  the  amazing  manifestations  of  abun¬ 
dance  and  devouring  gradually,  almost  imperceptibly,  died  away. 
Eventually,  ‘Askoy’  lay  once  more  in  water  that  seemed  as  still 
and  dead  as  oil,  and  the  lap-lap  of  skipping  waves  drew  off  far¬ 
ther  and  farther  into  the  distance  until  it  was  lost.* 

Although  such  exciting  displays  of  upwelling  are  seen  and 
recognized  by  comparatively  few  people,  the  process  takes  place 
regularly  off  a  number  of  coasts  and  at  many  places  in  the  open 
ocean.  Wherever  it  occurs,  it  is  responsible  for  a  profusion  of  life. 
Some  of  the  world’s  largest  fisheries  are  dependent  on  upwelling. 
The  coast  of  Algeria  is  famous  for  its  sardine  fisheries;  the  sar¬ 
dines  are  abundant  here  because  upward  streams  of  deep,  cold 
water  provide  the  minerals  to  support  astronomical  numbers  of 
diatoms.  The  west  coast  of  Morocco,  the  area  opposite  the  Ca¬ 
nary  and  Cape  Verde  islands,  and  the  southwest  coast  of  Africa 
are  other  sites  of  extensive  upwelling  and  consequent  richness  of 
marine  life.  There  is  an  amazingly  abundant  fish  fauna  in  the 
Arabian  Sea  near  Oman  and  on  the  Somali  Coast  near  Cape 
Hafun,  both  occurring  in  areas  of  cold  water  rising  from  the 
depths.  In  the  South  Equatorial  Current  north  of  Ascension 
Island  is  a  'tongue  of  cold’  produced  by  the  rise  of  sea  water  from 
the  bottom.  It  is  extraordinarily  rich  in  plankton.  Upwelling 
around  the  island  of  South  Georgia,  east  of  Cape  Horn,  makes

this  one  of  the  world's  centers  of  whaling.  On  the  west  coast  of 
the  United  States  the  catch  of  sardines  is  sometimes  as  much  as 
a  billion  pounds  in  a  year,  supporting  one  of  the  largest  fisheries 
in  the  world.  The  fishery  could  not  exist  except  for  upwelling, 
which  sets  off  the  old,  familiar  biological  chain:  salts,  diatoms, 
copepods,  herring.  Down  along  the  west  coast  of  South  America, 
the  astonishing  profusion  of  life  in  the  Humboldt  is  maintained 
by  upwelling,  which  not  only  keeps  the  waters  of  the  current  cold 
in  all  its  2500-mile  course  to  the  Galapagos  Islands  but  brings  up 
the  nutrient  salts  from  the  deeper  layers. 

When  upwelling  takes  place  along  coastlines,  it  is  the  result 
of  the  interplay  of  several  forces— the  winds,  the  surface  currents, 
the  rotation  of  the  earth,  and  the  shape  of  the  hidden  slopes 
of  the  continent's  foundations.  When  the  winds,  combined  with 
the  deflecting  effect  of  rotation,  blow  the  surface  waters  offshore, 
deep  water  must  rise  to  replace  it. 

Upwelling  may  occur  in  the  open  sea  as  well,  but  from  entirely 
different  causes.  Wherever  two  strongly  moving  currents  diverge, 
water  must  rise  from  below  to  fill  the  place  where  the  streams 
separate.  One  such  place  lies  at  the  westernmost  bounds  of  the 
Equatorial  Current  in  the  Pacific,  where  the  powerfully  moving 
stream  turns  and  pours  part  of  its  waters  back  into  the  counter- 
current,  and  part  northward  toward  Japan.  These  are  confused 
and  turbulent  waters.  There  is  the  strong  pull  to  the  north  by 
which  the  main  stream,  sensitive  to  the  force  of  the  rotating 
earth,  turns  to  the  right.  There  are  the  swirls  and  eddies  by  which 
the  lesser  stream  turns  again  upon  itself  and  flows  back  into  the 
eastern  Pacific.  There  is  the  rushing  up  from  below  to  fill  the 
otherwise  deepening  groove  between  the  streams.  In  the  result¬ 
ing  disquietude  of  the  ocean  waters,  chilled  and  enriched  from 
below,  the  smaller  organisms  of  the  plankton  thrive.  As  they 
multiply,  they  provide  food  for  the  larger  plankton  creatures, 
which,  in  turn,  provide  food  for  squid  and  fish.  These  waters  are 
prodigiously  rich  in  life,  and  there  is  evidence  that  they  may  have 
been  so  for  many  thousands  of  years.  Swedish  oceanographers  re¬ 
cently  found  that  under  these  areas  of  divergence  the  sediment

layer  is  exceptionally  thick— the  layer  composed  of  all  that  re¬ 
mains  of  the  billions  upon  billions  of  minute  creatures  that  have 
lived  and  died  in  this  place. 

The  downward  movement  of  surface  water  into  the  depths  is 
an  occurrence  as  dramatic  as  upwelling,  and  perhaps  it  fills  the 
human  mind  with  an  even  greater  sense  of  awe  and  mystery, 
because  it  cannot  be  seen  but  can  only  be  imagined.  At  several 
known  places  the  downward  flow  of  enormous  quantities  of  wa¬ 
ter  takes  place  regularly.  This  water  feeds  the  deep  currents  of 
whose  courses  we  have  only  the  dimmest  knowledge.  We  do 
know  that  it  is  all  part  of  the  ocean’s  system  of  balances,  by 
which  she  pays  back  to  one  part  of  her  waters  what  she  had  lat¬ 
terly  borrowed  for  distribution  to  another. 

The  North  Atlantic,  for  example,  receives  quantities  of  surface 
water  (some  6  million  cubic  meters  a  second)  from  the  South 
Atlantic  via  the  Equatorial  Current.  The  return  payment  is  made 
at  deep  levels,  partly  in  very  cold  arctic  water,  and  partly  in  some 
of  the  saltiest,  warmest  water  in  the  world,  that  of  the  Mediter¬ 
ranean.  There  are  two  places  for  the  down-flow  of  arctic  water. 
One  is  in  the  Labrador  Sea.  Another  is  southeast  of  Greenland. 
At  each  the  quantity  of  sinking  water  is  prodigious— some  2  mil¬ 
lion  cubic  meters  a  second.  The  deep  Mediterranean  water  flows 
out  over  the  sill  that  separates  the  basin  of  the  Mediterranean 
from  the  open  Atlantic.  This  sill  lies  about  150  fathoms  beneath 
the  surface  of  the  sea.  The  water  that  spills  over  its  rocky  edge 
does  so  because  of  the  unusual  conditions  that  prevail  in  the 
Mediterranean.  The  hot  sun  beating  down  on  its  nearly  enclosed 
water  creates  an  extraordinarily  high  rate  of  evaporation,  draw¬ 
ing  off  into  the  atmosphere  more  water  than  is  added  by  the  in¬ 
flow  of  rivers.  The  water  becomes  ever  saltier  and  more  dense; 
as  evaporation  continues  the  surface  of  the  Mediterranean  falls 
below  that  of  the  Atlantic.  To  correct  the  inequality,  lighter 
water  from  the  Atlantic  pours  past  Gibraltar  in  surface  streams 
of  great  strength. 

Now  we  give  the  matter  little  thought,  but  in  the  days  of  sail, 
passage  out  into  the  Atlantic  was  a  difficult  problem  because  of 


142

this  surface  current.  An  old  ship’s  log  of  the  year  1855  has  this  to 
say  of  the  current  and  its  practical  effect: 

Weather  fine;  made  iJ4  pt.  leeway.  At  noon,  stood  in  to  Almira 
Bay,  and  anchored  off  the  village  of  Roguetas.  Found  a  great 
number  of  vessels  waiting  for  a  chance  to  get  to  the  westward, 
and  learned  from  them  that  at  least  a  thousand  sail  are  weather¬ 
bound  between  this  and  Gibraltar.  Some  of  them  have  been  so 
for  six  weeks,  and  have  even  got  so  far  as  Malaga,  only  to  be 
swept  back  by  the  current.  Indeed,  no  vessel  has  been  able  to  get 
out  into  the  Atlantic  for  three  months  past. 

Later  measurements  show  that  these  surface  currents  flow  into 
the  Mediterranean  with  an  average  velocity  of  about  three  knots. 
The  bottom  current,  moving  out  into  the  Atlantic,  is  even 
stronger.  Its  outward  flow  is  so  vigorous  that  it  has  been  known 
to  wreck  oceanographic  instruments  sent  down  to  measure  it, 
apparently  pounding  them  against  stones  on  the  bottom;  and 
once  the  wire  of  the  Falmouth  cable  near  Gibraltar  ‘was  ground 
like  the  edge  of  a  razor,  so  that  it  had  to  be  abandoned  and  a 
new  one  laid  well  inshore/ 

The  water  that  sinks  in  the  arctic  regions  of  the  Atlantic,  as 
well  as  that  spilling  over  the  Gibraltar  sill,  spreads  out  widely 
into  the  deeper  parts  of  the  ocean  basins.  Traversing  the  North 
Atlantic,  it  crosses  the  equator  and  continues  to  the  south,  there 
passing  between  two  layers  of  water  that  are  moving  northward 
from  the  Antarctic  Sea.  Some  of  this  antarctic  water  mingles 
with  the  Atlantic  water — that  from  Greenland  and  Labrador  and 
the  Mediterranean— and  with  it  returns  south.  But  other  antarc¬ 
tic  water  moves  northward  across  the  equator  and  has  been 
traced  as  far  as  the  latitude  of  Cape  Hatteras. 

The  flow  of  these  deep  waters  is  hardly  a  ‘flow’  at  all;  its  pace 
is  ponderously  slow,  the  measured  creep  of  icy,  heavy  water.  But 
the  volumes  involved  are  prodigious,  and  the  areas  covered 
world-wide.  It  may  even  be  that  the  deep  ocean  water,  on  such 
global  wanderings,  acts  to  distribute  some  of  the  marine  fauna— 
not  the  surface  forms  but  the  dwellers  in  deep,  dark  layers.  From 
our  knowledge  of  the  source  of  the  currents,  it  seems  significant

that  some  of  the  same  species  of  deep-water  invertebrates  and 
fishes  have  been  collected  off  the  coast  of  South  Africa  and  off 
Greenland.  And  about  Bermuda,  where  a  greater  variety  of  deep¬ 
water  forms  has  been  found  than  anywhere  else,  there  is  a  min¬ 
gling  of  deep  water  from  the  Antarctic,  the  Arctic,  and  the  Medi¬ 
terranean.  Perhaps  in  these  sunless  streams  the  weird  inhabitants 
of  deep  waters  drift,  generation  after  generation,  surviving  and 
multiplying  because  of  the  almost  changeless  character  of  these 
slowly  moving  currents. 

There  is,  then,  no  water  that  is  wholly  of  the  Pacific,  or  wholly 
of  the  Atlantic,  or  of  the  Indian  or  the  Antarctic.  The  surf  that 
we  find  exhilarating  at  Virginia  Beach  or  at  La  Jolla  today  may 
have  lapped  at  the  base  of  antarctic  icebergs  or  sparkled  in  the 
Mediterranean  sun,  years  ago,  before  it  moved  through  dark  and 
unseen  waterways  to  the  place  we  find  it  now.  It  is  by  the  deep, 
hidden  currents  that  the  oceans  are  made  one. 


The  Moving  Tides 


IN  EVERY  COUNTRY  THE  MOON  KEEPS  EVER  THE  RULE  OF  ALLIANCE 
WITH  THE  SEA  WHICH  IT  ONCE  FOR  ALL  HAS  AGREED  UPON. 

— The  Venerable  Bede 


I  HERE  is  no  drop  of  water  in  the  ocean,  not  even  in  the 
deepest  parts  of  the  abyss,  that  does  not  know  and  respond  to 
the  mysterious  forces  that  create  the  tide.  No  other  force  that 
affects  the  sea  is  so  strong.  Compared  with  the  tide  the  wind- 
created  waves  are  surface  movements  felt,  at  most,  no  more  than 
a  hundred  fathoms  below  the  surface.  So,  despite  their  impres¬ 
sive  sweep,  are  the  planetary  currents,  which  seldom  involve 
more  than  the  upper  several  hundred  fathoms.  The  masses  of 
water  affected  by  the  tidal  movement  are  enormous,  as  will  be 
clear  from  one  example.  Into  one  small  bay  on  the  east  coast  of 
North  America— Passamaquoddy — 2  billion  tons  of  water  are 
carried  by  the  tidal  currents  twice  each  day;  into  the  whole  Bay 
of  Fundy,  100  billion  tons. 

Here  and  there  we  find  dramatic  illustration  of  the  fact  that 
the  tides  affect  the  whole  ocean,  from  its  surface  to  its  floor.  The 
meeting  of  opposing  tidal  currents  in  the  Strait  of  Messina 
creates  whirlpools  (one  of  them  is  Charybdis  of  classical  fame) 
which  so  deeply  stir  the  waters  of  the  strait  that  fish  bearing  all

the  marks  of  abyssal  existence,  their  eyes  atrophied  or  abnor¬ 
mally  large,  their  bodies  studded  with  phosphorescent  organs, 
frequently  are  cast  up  on  the  lighthouse  beach,  and  the  whole 
area  yields  a  rich  collection  of  deep-sea  fauna  for  the  Institute  of 
Marine  Biology  at  Messina. 

The  tides  are  a  response  of  the  mobile  waters  of  the  ocean  to 
the  pull  of  the  moon  and  the  more  distant  sun.  In  theory,  there 
is  a  gravitational  attraction  between  every  drop  of  sea  water  and 
even  the  outermost  star  of  the  universe.  In  practice,  however, 
the  pull  of  the  remote  stars  is  so  slight  as  to  be  obliterated  in  the 
vaster  movements  by  which  the  ocean  yields  to  the  moon  and 
the  sun.  Anyone  who  has  lived  near  tidewater  knows  that  the 
moon,  far  more  than  the  sun,  controls  the  tides.  He  has  noticed 
that,  just  as  the  moon  rises  later  each  day  by  fifty  minutes,  on  the 
average,  than  the  day  before,  so,  in  most  places,  the  time  of  high 
tide  is  correspondingly  later  each  day.  And  as  the  moon  waxes 
and  wanes  in  its  monthly  cycle,  so  the  height  of  the  tide  varies. 
Twice  each  month,  when  the  moon  is  a  mere  thread  of  silver  in 
the  sky,  and  again  when  it  is  full,  we  have  the  strongest  tidal 
movements— the  highest  flood  tides  and  the  lowest  ebb  tides  of 
the  lunar  month.  These  are  called  the  spring  tides.  At  these 
times  sun,  moon,  and  earth  are  directly  in  line  and  the  pull  of 
the  two  heavenly  bodies  is  added  together  to  bring  the  water 
high  on  the  beaches,  and  send  its  surf  leaping  upward  against 
the  sea  cliffs,  and  draw  a  brimming  tide  into  the  harbors  so  that 
the  boats  float  high  beside  their  wharfs.  And  twice  each  month, 
at  the  quarters  of  the  moon,  when  sun,  moon,  and  earth  lie  at 
the  apexes  of  a  triangle,  and  the  pull  of  sun  and  moon  are  op¬ 
posed,  we  have  the  moderate  tidal  movements  called  the  neap 
tides.  Then  the  difference  between  high  and  lower  water  is  less 
than  at  any  other  time  during  the  month. 

That  the  sun,  with  a  mass  27  million  times  that  of  the  moon, 
should  have  less  influence  over  the  tides  than  a  small  satellite  of 
the  earth  is  at  first  surprising.  But  in  the  mechanics  of  the  uni¬ 
verse,  nearness  counts  for  more  than  distant  mass,  and  when  all 
the  mathematical  calculations  have  been  made  we  find  that  the 
moon’s  power  over  the  tides  is  more  than  twice  that  of  the  sun. 


The  Restless  Sea

The  tides  are  enormously  more  complicated  than  all  this 
would  suggest.  The  influence  of  sun  and  moon  is  constantly 
changing,  varying  with  the  phases  of  the  moon,  with  the  distance 
of  moon  and  sun  from  the  earth,  and  with  the  position  of  each 
to  north  or  south  of  the  equator.  They  are  complicated  further 
by  the  fact  that  every  body  of  water,  whether  natural  or  artificial, 
has  its  own  period  of  oscillation.  Disturb  its  waters  and  they  will 
move  with  a  seesaw  or  rocking  motion,  with  the  most  pro¬ 
nounced  movement  at  the  ends  of  the  container,  the  least  mo¬ 
tion  at  the  center.  Tidal  scientists  now  believe  that  the  ocean 
contains  a  number  of  ‘basins/  each  with  its  own  period  of  oscil¬ 
lation  determined  by  its  length  and  depth.  The  disturbance  that 
sets  the  water  in  motion  is  the  attracting  force  of  the  moon  and 
sun.  But  the  kind  of  motion,  that  is,  the  period  of  the  swing  of 
the  water,  depends  upon  the  physical  dimensions  of  the  basin. 
What  this  means  in  terms  of  actual  tides  we  shall  presently  see. 

The  tides  present  a  striking  paradox,  and  the  essence  of  it  is 
this :  the  force  that  sets  them  in  motion  is  cosmic,  lying  wholly 
outside  the  earth  and  presumably  acting  impartially  on  all  parts 
of  the  globe,  but  the  nature  of  the  tide  at  any  particular  place  is 
a  local  matter,  with  astonishing  differences  occurring  within  a 
very  short  geographic  distance.  When  we  spend  a  long  summer 
holiday  at  the  seashore  we  may  become  aware  that  the  tide  in 
our  cove  behaves  very  differently  from  that  at  a  friend's  place 
twenty  miles  up  the  coast,  and  is  strikingly  different  from  what 
we  may  have  known  in  some  other  locality.  If  we  are  summering 
on  Nantucket  Island  our  boating  and  swimming  will  be  little  dis¬ 
turbed  by  the  tides,  for  the  range  between  high  water  and  low 
is  only  about  a  foot  or  two.  But  if  we  choose  to  vacation  near  the 
upper  part  of  the  Bay  of  Fundy,  we  must  accommodate  ourselves 
to  a  rise  and  fall  of  40  to  50  feet,  although  both  places  are  in¬ 
cluded  within  the  same  body  of  water— the  Gulf  of  Maine.  Or  if 
we  spend  our  holiday  on  Chesapeake  Bay  we  may  find  that  the 
time  of  high  water  each  day  varies  by  as  much  as  12  hours  in 
different  places  on  the  shores  of  the  same  bay. 

The  truth  of  the  matter  is  that  local  topography  is  all-impor¬ 
tant  in  determining  the  features  that  to  our  minds  make  ‘the

tide.  The  attractive  force  of  the  heavenly  bodies  sets  the  water 
in  motion,  but  how,  and  how  far,  and  how  strongly  it  will  rise 
depend  on  such  things  as  the  slope  of  the  bottom,  the  depth  of 
a  channel,  or  the  width  of  a  bay’s  entrance. 

The  United  States  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey  has  a  remark¬ 
able,  robotlike  machine  with  which  it  can  predict  the  time  and 
height  of  the  tide  on  any  past  or  future  date,  for  any  part  of  the 
world,  on  one  essential  condition.  This  is  that  at  some  time  local 
observations  must  have  been  made  to  show  how  the  topographic 
features  of  the  place  modify  and  direct  the  tidal  movements. 

Perhaps  the  most  striking  differences  are  in  the  range  of  tide, 
which  varies  tremendously  in  different  parts  of  the  world,  so  that 
what  the  inhabitants  of  one  place  might  consider  disastrously 
high  water  might  be  regarded  as  no  tide  at  all  by  coastal  com¬ 
munities  only  a  hundred  miles  distant.  The  highest  tides  in  the 
world  occur  in  the  Bay  of  Fundy,  with  a  rise  of  about  50  feet  in 
Minas  Basin  near  the  head  of  the  Bay  at  the  spring  tides.  At 
least  half  a  dozen  other  places  scattered  around  the  world  have  a 
tidal  range  of  more  than  30  feet— Puerto  Gallegos  in  Argentina 
and  Cook  Inlet  in  Alaska,  Frobisher  Bay  in  Davis  Strait,  the 
Koksoak  River  emptying  into  Hudson  Strait,  and  the  Bay  of 
St.  Malo  in  France  come  to  mind.  At  many  other  places  'high 
tide’  may  mean  a  rise  of  only  a  foot  or  so,  perhaps  only  a  few 
inches.  The  tides  of  Tahiti  rise  and  fall  in  a  gentle  movement, 
with  a  difference  of  no  more  than  a  foot  between  high  water  and 
low.  On  most  oceanic  islands  the  range  of  the  tide  is  slight.  But 
it  is  never  safe  to  generalize  about  the  kinds  of  places  that  have 
high  or  low  tides,  because  two  areas  that  are  not  far  apart  may 
respond  in  very  different  ways  to  the  tide-producing  forces.  At 
the  Atlantic  end  of  the  Panama  Canal  the  tidal  range  is  not 
more  than  1  or  2  feet,  but  at  the  Pacific  end,  only  40  miles  away, 
the  range  is  12  to  16  feet.  The  Sea  of  Okhotsk  is  another  ex¬ 
ample  of  the  way  the  height  of  the  tide  varies.  Throughout  much 
of  the  Sea  the  tides  are  moderate— only  about  2  feet— but  in 
some  parts  of  the  Sea  there  is  a  10-foot  rise,  and  at  the  head  of 
one  of  its  arms— the  Gulf  of  Penjinsk— the  rise  is  37  feet. 

What  is  it  about  one  place  that  will  bring  40  or  50  feet  of 


The  Restless  Sea 


148 

water  rising  about  its  shores,  while  at  another  place  lying  under 
the  same  moon  and  sun,  the  tide  will  rise  only  a  few  inches? 
What,  for  example,  can  be  the  explanation  of  the  great  tides  on 
the  Bay  of  Fundy,  while  only  a  few  hundred  miles  away  at  Nan¬ 
tucket  Island,  on  the  shores  of  the  same  ocean,  the  tide  range  is 
little  more  than  a  foot? 

The  modern  theory  of  tidal  oscillation  seems  to  offer  the  best 
explanation  of  such  local  differences — the  rocking  up  and  down 
of  water  in  each  natural  basin  about  a  central,  virtually  tideless 
node.  Nantucket  is  located  near  the  node  of  its  basin,  where 
there  is  little  motion,  hence  a  small  tide  range.  Passing  north¬ 
eastward  along  the  shores  of  this  basin,  we  find  the  tides  becom¬ 
ing  progressively  higher,  with  a  6-foot  range  at  Nauset  Harbor 
on  Cape  Cod,  8.9  feet  at  Gloucester,  15.7  feet  at  West  Quoddy 
Head,  20.9  feet  at  St.  John,  and  39.4  feet  at  Folly  Point.  The 
Nova  Scotia  shore  of  the  Bay  of  Fundy  has  somewhat  higher 
tides  than  the  corresponding  points  on  the  New  Brunswick 
shore,  and  the  highest  tides  of  all  are  in  Minas  Basin  at  the  head 
of  the  Bay.  The  immense  movements  of  water  in  the  Bay  of 
Fundy  result  from  a  combination  of  circumstances.  The  bay  lies 
at  the  end  of  an  oscillating  basin.  Furthermore,  the  natural 
period  of  oscillation  of  the  basin  is  approximately  12  hours.  This 
very  nearly  coincides  with  the  period  of  the  ocean  tide.  There¬ 
fore  the  water  movement  within  the  bay  is  sustained  and  enor¬ 
mously  increased  by  the  ocean  tide.  The  narrowing  and  shallow¬ 
ing  of  the  bay  in  its  upper  reaches,  compelling  the  huge  masses 
of  water  to  crowd  into  a  constantly  diminishing  area,  also  con¬ 
tribute  to  the  great  heights  of  the  Fundy  tides. 

The  tidal  rhythms,  as  well  as  the  range  of  tide,  vary  from  ocean 
to  ocean.  Flood  tide  and  ebb  succeed  each  other  around  the 
world,  as  night  follows  day,  but  as  to  whether  there  shall  be  two 
high  tides  and  two  low  in  each  lunar  day,  or  only  one,  there  is  no 
unvarying  rule.  To  those  who  know  best  the  Atlantic  Ocean— 
either  its  eastern  or  western  shores— the  rhythm  of  two  high  tides 
and  two  low  tides  in  each  day  seems  ‘normal/  Here,  on  each 
flood  tide,  the  water  advances  about  as  far  as  the  preceding 
high;  and  succeeding  ebb  tides  fall  about  equally  low.  But  in  that 


The  Moving  Tides 


149 

great  inland  sea  of  the  Atlantic,  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  a  different 
rhythm  prevails  around  most  of  its  borders.  At  best  the  tidal  rise 
here  is  but  a  slight  movement,  of  no  more  than  a  foot  or  two.  At 
certain  places  on  the  shores  of  the  Gulf  it  is  a  long,  deliberate 
undulation— one  rise  and  one  fall  in  the  lunar  day  of  24  hours 
plus  50  minutes— resembling  the  untroubled  breathing  of  that 
earth  monster  to  whom  the  ancients  attributed  all  tides.  This 

diurnal  rhythm'  is  found  in  scattered  places  about  the  earth _ 

such  as  at  Saint  Michael,  Alaska,  and  at  Do  Son  in  French 
Indo-China  as  well  as  in  the  Gulf  of  M^exico.  By  far  the  greater 
part  of  the  world’s  coasts— most  of  the  Pacific  basin  and  the 
shores  of  the  Indian  Ocean— display  a  mixture  of  the  diurnal  and 
semidiurnal  types  of  tide.  There  are  two  high  and  two  low  tides 
in  a  day,  but  the  succeeding  floods  may  be  so  unequal  that  the 
second  scarcely  rises  to  mean  sea  level;  or  it  may  be  the  ebb  tides 
that  are  of  extreme  inequality. 

There  seems  to  be  no  simple  explanation  of  why  some  parts 
of  the  ocean  should  respond  to  the  pull  of  sun  and  moon  with 
one  rhythm  and  other  parts  with  another,  although  the  matter  is 
perfectly  clear  to  tidal  scientists  on  the  basis  of  mathematical 
calculations.  To  gain  some  inkling  of  the  reasons,  we  must  recall 
the  many  separate  components  of  the  tide-producing  force, 
which  in  turn  result  from  the  changing  relative  positions  of  sun, 
moon,  and  earth.  Depending  on  local  geographic  features,  every 
part  of  earth  and  sea,  while  affected  in  some  degree  by  each  com¬ 
ponent,  is  more  responsive  to  some  than  to  others.  Presumably 
the  shape  and  depths  of  the  Atlantic  basin  cause  it  to  respond 
most  strongly  to  the  forces  that  produce  a  semidiurnal  rhythm. 
The  Pacific  and  Indian  oceans,  on  the  other  hand,  are  affected 
by  both  the  diurnal  and  semidiurnal  forces,  and  a  mixed  tide 
results. 

The  island  of  Tahiti  is  a  classic  example  of  the  way  even  a 
small  area  may  react  to  one  of  the  tide-producing  forces  to  the 
virtual  exclusion  of  the  others.  On  Tahiti,  it  is  sometimes  said, 
you  can  tell  the  time  of  day  by  looking  out  at  the  beach  and 
noticing  the  stage  of  the  tide.  This  is  not  strictly  true,  but  the 
legend  has  a  certain  basis.  With  slight  variations,  high  tide  oc- 


150 


The  Restless  Sea 


curs  at  noon  and  at  midnight;  low  water,  at  six  o’clock  morning 
and  evening.  The  tides  thus  ignore  the  effect  of  the  moon,  which 
is  to  advance  the  time  of  the  tides  by  50  minutes  each  day.  Why 
should  the  tides  of  Tahiti  follow  the  sun  instead  of  the  moon? 
The  most  favored  explanation  is  that  the  island  lies  at  the  axis 
or  node  of  one  of  the  basins  set  in  oscillation  by  the  moon. 
There  is  very  little  motion  in  response  to  the  moon  at  this  point, 
and  the  waters  are  therefore  free  to  move  in  the  rhythm  induced 
by  the  sun. 

If  the  history  of  the  earth’s  tides  should  one  day  be  written  by 
some  observer  of  the  universe,  it  would  no  doubt  be  said  that 
they  reached  their  greatest  grandeur  and  power  in  the  younger 
days  of  Earth,  and  that  they  slowly  grew  feebler  and  less  impos¬ 
ing  until  one  day  they  ceased  to  be.  For  the  tides  were  not  al¬ 
ways  as  they  are  today,  and  as  with  all  that  is  earthly,  their  days 
are  numbered. 

In  the  days  when  the  earth  was  young,  the  coming  in  of  the 
tide  must  have  been  a  stupendous  event.  If  the  moon  was,  as  we 
have  supposed  in  an  earlier  chapter,  formed  by  the  tearing  away 
of  a  part  of  the  outer  crust  of  the  earth,  it  must  have  remained 
for  a  time  very  close  to  its  parent.  Its  present  position  is  the  con¬ 
sequence  of  being  pushed  farther  and  farther  away  from  the 
earth  for  some  2  billion  years.  When  it  was  half  its  present  dis¬ 
tance  from  the  earth,  its  power  over  the  ocean  tides  was  eight 
times  as  great  as  now,  and  the  tidal  range  may  even  then  have 
been  several  hundred  feet  on  certain  shores.  But  when  the  earth 
was  only  a  few  million  years  old,  assuming  that  the  deep  ocean 
basins  were  then  formed,  the  sweep  of  the  tides  must  have  been 
beyond  all  comprehension.  Twice  each  day,  the  fury  of  the  in¬ 
coming  waters  would  inundate  all  the  margins  of  the  continents. 
The  range  of  the  surf  must  have  been  enormously  extended  by 
the  reach  of  the  tides,  so  that  the  waves  would  batter  the  crests 
of  high  cliffs  and  sweep  inland  to  erode  the  continents.  The  fury 
of  such  tides  would  contribute  not  a  little  to  the  general  bleak¬ 
ness  and  grimness  and  uninhabitability  of  the  young  earth. 

Under  such  conditions,  no  living  thing  could  exist  on  the 


The  Moving  Tides 


151 

shores  or  pass  beyond  them,  and,  had  conditions  not  changed, 
it  is  reasonable  to  suppose  that  life  would  have  evolved  no  fur¬ 
ther  than  the  fishes.  But  over  the  millions  of  years  the  moon  has 
receded,  driven  away  by  the  friction  of  the  tides  it  creates.  The 
very  movement  of  the  water  over  the  bed  of  the  ocean,  over  the 
shallow  edges  of  the  continents,  and  over  the  inland  seas  carries 
within  itself  the  power  that  is  slowly  destroying  the  tides,  for 
tidal  friction  is  gradually  slowing  down  the  rotation  of  the  earth. 
In  those  early  days  we  have  spoken  of,  it  took  the  earth  a  much 
shorter  time— perhaps  only  about  4  hours— to  make  a  complete 
rotation  on  its  axis.  Since  then,  the  spinning  of  the  globe  has 
been  so  greatly  slowed  that  a  rotation  now  requires,  as  everyone 
knows,  about  24  hours.  This  retarding  will  continue,  according 
to  mathematicians,  until  the  day  is  about  50  times  as  long  as 
it  is  now. 

And  all  the  while  the  tidal  friction  will  be  exerting  a  second 
effect,  pushing  the  moon  farther  way,  just  as  it  has  already 
pushed  it  out  more  than  200,000  miles.  (According  to  the  laws 
of  mechanics,  as  the  rotation  of  the  earth  is  retarded,  that  of  the 
moon  must  be  accelerated,  and  centrifugal  force  will  carry  it 
farther  away.)  As  the  moon  recedes,  it  will,  of  course,  have  less 
power  over  the  tides  and  they  will  grow  weaker.  It  will  also  take 
the  moon  longer  to  complete  its  orbit  around  the  earth.  When 
finally  the  length  of  the  day  and  of  the  month  coincide,  the 
moon  will  no  longer  rotate  relatively  to  the  earth,  and  there  will 
be  no  lunar  tides. 

All  this,  of  course,  will  require  time  on  a  scale  the  mind  finds 
it  difficult  to  conceive,  and  before  it  happens  it  is  quite  probable 
that  the  human  race  will  have  vanished  from  the  earth.  This  may 
seem,  then,  like  a  Wellsian  fantasy  of  a  world  so  remote  that  we 
may  dismiss  it  from  our  thoughts.  But  already,  even  in  our  al¬ 
lotted  fraction  of  earthly  time,  we  can  see  some  of  the  effects  of 
these  cosmic  processes.  Our  day  is  believed  to  be  several  seconds 
longer  than  that  of  Babylonian  times.  Britain’s  Astronomer 
Royal  recently  called  the  attention  of  the  American  Philosophi¬ 
cal  Society  to  the  fact  that  the  world  will  soon  have  to  choose 


The  Restless  Sea

between  two  kinds  of  time.  The  tide-induced  lengthening  of  the 
day  has  already  complicated  the  problems  of  human  systems  of 
keeping  time.  Conventional  clocks,  geared  to  the  earth’s  rota¬ 
tion,  do  not  show  the  effect  of  the  lengthening  days.  New  atomic 
clocks  now  being  constructed  will  show  actual  time  and  will 
differ  from  other  clocks. 

Although  the  tides  have  become  tamer,  and  their  range  is  now 
measured  in  tens  instead  of  hundreds  of  feet,  mariners  are  never¬ 
theless  greatly  concerned  not  only  with  the  stages  of  the  tide  and 
the  set  of  the  tidal  currents,  but  with  the  many  violent  move¬ 
ments  and  disturbances  of  the  sea  that  are  indirectly  related  to 
the  tides.  Nothing  the  human  mind  has  invented  can  tame  a 
tide  rip  or  control  the  rhythm  of  the  waters  ebb  and  flow,  and 
the  most  modern  instruments  cannot  carry  a  vessel  over  a  shoal 
until  the  tide  has  brought  a  sufficient  depth  of  water  over  it. 
Even  the  Queen  Mary  waits  for  slack  water  to  come  to  her  pier 
in  New  York;  otherwise  the  set  of  the  tidal  current  might  swing 
her  against  the  pier  with  enough  force  to  crush  it.  On  the  Bay  of 
Fundy,  because  of  the  great  range  of  tide,  harbor  activities  in 
some  of  the  ports  follow  a  pattern  as  rhythmic  as  the  tides  them¬ 
selves,  for  vessels  can  come  to  the  docks  to  take  on  or  discharge 
cargo  during  only  a  few  hours  on  each  tide,  leaving  promptly  to 
avoid  being  stranded  in  mud  at  low  water. 

In  the  confinement  of  narrow  passages  or  when  opposed  by 
contrary  winds  and  swells,  the  tidal  currents  often  move  with 
uncontrollable  violence,  creating  some  of  the  most  dangerous 
waterways  of  the  world.  It  is  only  necessary  to  read  the  Coast 
Pilots  and  Sailing  Directions  for  various  parts  of  the  world  to 
understand  the  menace  of  such  tidal  currents  to  navigation. 

'Vessels  around  the  Aleutians  are  in  more  danger  from  tidal 
currents  than  from  any  other  cause,  save  the  lack  of  surveys,’ 
says  the  postwar  edition  of  the  Alaska  Pilot.  Through  Unalga  and 
Akutan  passes,  which  are  among  the  most-used  routes  for  vessels 
entering  Bering  Sea  from  the  Pacific,  strong  tidal  currents  pour, 
making  their  force  felt  well  offshore  and  setting  vessels  unex¬ 
pectedly  against  the  rocks.  Through  Akun  Strait  the  flood  tide 


The  Moving  Tides

has  the  velocity  of  a  mountain  torrent,  with  dangerous  swirls 
and  overfalls.  In  each  of  these  passes  the  tide  will  raise  heavy, 
choppy  seas  if  opposed  by  wind  or  swells.  'Vessels  must  be  pre¬ 
pared  to  take  seas  aboard/  warns  the  Pilot ,  for  a  15-foot  wave 
of  a  tide  rip  may  suddenly  rise  and  sweep  across  a  vessel,  and 
more  than  one  man  has  been  carried  off  to  his  death  in  this  way. 

On  the  opposite  side  of  the  world,  the  tide  setting  eastward 
from  the  open  Atlantic  presses  between  the  islands  of  the  Shet- 
lands  and  Orkneys  into  the  North  Sea,  and  on  the  ebb  returns 
through  the  same  narrow  passages.  At  certain  stages  of  the  tide 
these  waters  are  dotted  with  dangerous  eddies,  with  strange  up¬ 
ward  domings,  or  with  sinister  pits  or  depressions.  Even  in  calm 
weather  boats  are  warned  to  avoid  the  eddies  of  Pentland  Firth, 
which  are  known  as  the  Swilkie;  and  with  an  ebb  tide  and  a 
northwest  wind  the  heavy  breaking  seas  of  the  Swilkie  are  a 
menace  to  vessels  'which  few,  having  once  experienced,  would 
be  rash  enough  to  encounter  a  second  time/ 

Edgar  Allan  Poe,  in  his  'Descent  into  the  Maelstrom/  con¬ 
verted  one  of  the  more  evil  manifestations  of  the  tide  into  litera¬ 
ture.  Few  who  have  read  the  story  will  forget  its  drama— how  the 
old  man  led  his  companion  to  a  mountain  cliff  high  above  the 
sea  and  let  him  watch  the  water  far  below  in  the  narrow  passage¬ 
way  between  the  islands,  with  its  sinister  foam  and  scum,  its 
uneasy  bubbling  and  boiling,  until  suddenly  the  whirlpool  was 
formed  before  his  eyes  and  rushed  with  an  appalling  sound 
through  the  narrow  waterway.  Then  the  old  man  told  the  story 
of  his  own  descent  into  the  whirlpool  and  of  his  miraculous  es¬ 
cape.  Most  of  us  have  wondered  how  much  of  the  story  was  fact, 
how  much  the  creation  of  Poe’s  fertile  imagination.  There  actu¬ 
ally  is  a  Maelstrom  and  it  exists  where  Poe  placed  it,  between 
two  of  the  islands  of  the  Lofoten  group  off  the  west  coast  of 
Norway.  It  is,  as  he  described  it,  a  gigantic  whirlpool  or  series  of 
whirlpools,  and  men  with  their  boats  have  actually  been  drawn 
down  into  these  spinning  funnels  of  water.  Although  Poe’s  ac¬ 
count  exaggerates  certain  details,  the  essential  facts  on  which  he 
based  his  narrative  are  verified  in  the  Sailing  Directions  for  the 


154  The  Restless  Sea 

Northwest  and  North  Coasts  of  Norway,  a  practical  and  circum¬ 
stantial  document: 

Though  rumor  has  greatly  exaggerated  the  importance  of  the 
Malstrom,  or  more  properly  Moskenstraumen,  which  runs  be¬ 
tween  Mosken  and  Lofotodden,  it  is  still  the  most  dangerous 
tideway  in  Lofoten,  its  violence  being  due,  in  great  measure,  to 
the  irregularity  of  the  ground  ...  As  the  strength  of  the  tide 
increases  the  sea  becomes  heavier  and  the  current  more  irregular, 
forming  extensive  eddies  or  whirlpools  (Malstrom).  During  such 
periods  no  vessel  should  enter  the  Moskenstraumen. 

These  whirlpools  are  cavities  in  the  form  of  an  inverted  bell, 
wide  and  rounded  at  the  mouth  and  narrower  toward  the  bot¬ 
tom;  they  are  largest  when  first  formed  and  are  carried  along 
with  the  current,  diminishing  gradually  until  they  disappear; 
before  the  extinction  of  one,  two  or  three  more  will  appear,  fol¬ 
lowing  each  other  like  so  many  pits  in  the  sea  .  .  .  Fishermen 
affirm  that  if  they  are  aware  of  their  approach  to  a  whirlpool  and 
have  time  to  throw  an  oar  or  any  other  bulky  body  into  it  they 
will  get  over  it  safely;  the  reason  is  that  when  the  continuity  is 
broken  and  the  whirling  motion  of  the  sea  interrupted  by  some¬ 
thing  thrown  into  it  the  water  must  rush  suddenly  in  on  all  sides 
and  fill  up  the  cavity.  For  the  same  reason,  in  strong  breezes, 
when  the  waves  break,  though  there  may  be  a  whirling  round, 
there  can  be  no  cavity.  In  the  Saltstrom  boats  and  men  have  been 
drawn  down  by  these  vortices,  and  much  loss  of  life  has  resulted. 

Among  unusual  creations  of  the  tide,  perhaps  the  best  known 
are  the  bores.  The  world  possesses  half  a  dozen  or  more  famous 
ones.  A  bore  is  created  when  a  great  part  of  the  flood  tide  enters 
a  river  as  a  single  wave,  or  at  most  two  or  three  waves,  with  a 
steep  and  high  front.  The  conditions  that  produce  bores  are  sev¬ 
eral:  there  must  be  a  considerable  range  of  tide,  combined  with 
sand  bars  or  other  obstructions  in  the  mouth  of  the  river,  so  that 
the  tide  is  hindered  and  held  back,  until  it  finally  gathers  itself 
together  and  rushes  through.  The  Amazon  is  remarkable  for  the 
distance  its  bore  travels  upstream— some  200  miles— with  the  re¬ 
sult  that  the  bores  of  as  many  as  5  flood  tides  may  actually  be 
moving  up  the  river  at  one  time. 

On  the  Tsientang  River,  which  empties  into  the  China  Sea,  all 


The  Moving  Tides 


*55 

shipping  is  controlled  by  the  bore — the  largest,  most  dangerous, 
and  best  known  in  the  world.  The  ancient  Chinese  used  to  throw 
offerings  into  the  river  to  appease  the  angry  spirit  of  this  bore, 
whose  size  and  fury  appear  to  have  varied  from  century  to  cen¬ 
tury,  or  perhaps  even  from  decade  to  decade,  as  the  silting  of 
the  estuary  has  shifted  and  changed.  During  most  of  the  month 
the  bore  now  advances  up  the  river  in  a  wave  8  to  1 1  feet  high, 
moving  at  a  speed  of  12  to  13  knots,  its  front  'a  sloping  cascade 
of  bubbling  foam,  falling  forward  and  pounding  on  itself  and  on 
the  river.’  Its  full  ferocity  is  reserved  for  the  spring  tides  of  the 
full  moon  and  the  new  moon,  at  which  times  the  crest  of  the  ad¬ 
vancing  wave  is  said  to  rise  25  feet  above  the  surface  of  the  river. 

There  are  bores,  though  none  so  spectacular,  in  North  Amer¬ 
ica.  There  is  one  at  Moncton,  on  New  Brunswick’s  Petitcodiac 
River,  but  it  is  impressive  only  on  the  spring  tides  of  the  full  or 
new  moon.  At  Turnagain  Arm  in  Cook  Inlet,  Alaska,  where  the 
tides  are  high  and  the  currents  strong,  the  flood  tide  under  cer¬ 
tain  conditions  comes  in  as  a  bore.  Its  advancing  front  may  be 
four  to  six  feet  high  and  is  recognized  as  being  so  dangerous  to 
small  craft  that  boats  are  beached  well  above  the  level  of  the 
flats  when  the  bore  is  approaching.  It  can  be  heard  about  half 
an  hour  before  its  arrival  at  any  point,  traveling  slowly  with  a 
sound  as  of  breakers  on  a  beach. 

The  influence  of  the  tide  over  the  affairs  of  sea  creatures  as 
well  as  men  may  be  seen  all  over  the  world.  The  billions  upon 
billions  of  sessile  animals,  like  oysters,  mussels,  and  barnacles, 
owe  their  very  existence  to  the  sweep  of  the  tides,  which  brings 
them  the  food  which  they  are  unable  to  go  in  search  of.  By  mar¬ 
velous  adaptations  of  form  and  structure,  the  inhabitants  of  the 
world  between  the  tide  lines  are  enabled  to  live  in  a  zone  where 
the  danger  of  being  dried  up  is  matched  against  the  danger  of 
being  washed  away,  where  for  every  enemy  that  comes  by  sea 
there  is  another  that  comes  by  land,  and  where  the  most  delicate 
of  living  tissues  must  somehow  withstand  the  assault  of  storm 
waves  that  have  the  power  to  shift  tons  of  rock  or  to  crack  the 
hardest  granite. 

The  most  curious  and  incredibly  delicate  adaptations,  how- 


The  Restless  Sea

ever,  are  the  ones  by  which  the  breeding  rhythm  of  certain  ma¬ 
rine  animals  is  timed  to  coincide  with  the  phases  of  the  moon 
and  the  stages  of  the  tide.  In  Europe  it  has  been  well  established 
that  the  spawning  activities  of  oysters  reach  their  peak  on  the 
spring  tides,  which  are  about  two  days  after  the  full  or  the  new 
moon.  In  the  waters  of  northern  Africa  there  is  a  sea  urchin  that, 
on  the  nights  when  the  moon  is  full  and  apparently  only  then, 
releases  its  reproductive  cells  into  the  sea.  And  in  tropical  waters 
in  many  parts  of  the  world  there  are  small  marine  worms  whose 
spawning  behavior  is  so  precisely  adjusted  to  the  tidal  calendar 
that,  merely  from  observing  them,  one  could  tell  the  month,  the 
day,  and  often  the  time  of  day  as  well. 

Near  Samoa  in  the  Pacific,  the  palolo  worm  lives  out  its  life  on 
the  bottom  of  the  shallow  sea,  in  holes  in  the  rocks  and  among 
the  masses  of  corals.  Twice  each  year,  during  the  neap  tides  of 
the  moon’s  last  quarter  in  October  and  November,  the  worms 
forsake  their  burrows  and  rise  to  the  surface  in  swarms  that  cover 
the  water.  For  this  purpose,  each  worm  has  literally  broken  its 
body  in  two,  half  to  remain  in  its  rocky  tunnel,  half  to  carry  the 
reproductive  products  to  the  surface  and  there  to  liberate  the 
cells.  This  happens  at  dawn  on  the  day  before  the  moon  reaches 
its  last  quarter,  and  again  on  the  following  day;  on  the  second 
day  of  the  spawning  the  quantity  of  eggs  liberated  is  so  great 
that  the  sea  is  discolored. 

The  Fijians,  whose  waters  have  a  similar  worm,  call  them 
‘Mbalolo’  and  have  designated  the  periods  of  their  spawning 
‘Mbalolo  lailai’  (little)  for  October  and  ‘Mbalolo  levu’  (large) 
for  November.  Similar  forms  near  the  Gilbert  Islands  respond  to 
certain  phases  of  the  moon  in  June  and  July;  in  the  Malay  Archi¬ 
pelago  a  related  worm  swarms  at  the  surface  on  the  second  and 
third  nights  after  the  full  moon  of  March  and  April,  when  the 
tides  are  running  highest.  A  Japanese  palolo  swarms  after  the 
new  moon  and  again  after  the  full  moon  in  October  and  No¬ 
vember. 

Concerning  each  of  these,  the  question  recurs  but  remains  un¬ 
answered:  is  it  the  state  of  the  tides  that  in  some  unknown  way 
supplies  the  impulse  from  which  springs  this  behavior,  or  is  it, 


The  Moving  Tides

even  more  mysteriously,  some  other  influence  of  the  moon?  It  is 
easier  to  imagine  that  it  is  the  press  and  the  rhythmic  movement 
of  the  water  that  in  some  way  brings  about  this  response.  But 
why  is  it  only  certain  tides  of  the  year,  and  why  for  some  species 
is  it  the  fullest  tides  of  the  month  and  for  others  the  least  move¬ 
ments  of  the  waters  that  are  related  to  the  perpetuation  of  the 
race?  At  present,  no  one  can  answer. 

No  other  creature  displays  so  exquisite  an  adaptation  to  the 
tidal  rhythm  as  the  grunion— a  small,  shimmering  fish  about  as 
long  as  a  man’s  hand.  Through  no  one  can  say  what  processes  of 
adaptation,  extending  over  no  one  knows  how  many  millennia, 
the  grunion  has  come  to  know  not  only  the  daily  rhythm  of  the 
tides,  but  the  monthly  cycle  by  which  certain  tides  sweep  higher 
on  the  beaches  than  others.  It  has  so  adapted  its  spawning  habits 
to  the  tidal  cycle  that  the  very  existence  of  the  race  depends  on 
the  precision  of  this  adjustment. 

Shortly  after  the  full  moon  of  the  months  from  March  to  Au¬ 
gust,  the  grunion  appear  in  the  surf  on  the  beaches  of  California. 
The  tide  reaches  flood  stage,  slackens,  hesitates,  and  begins  to 
ebb.  Now  on  these  waves  of  the  ebbing  tide  the  fish  begin  to 
come  in.  Their  bodies  shimmer  in  the  light  of  the  moon  as  they 
are  borne  up  the  beach  on  the  crest  of  a  wave,  they  lie  glittering 
on  the  wet  sand  for  a  perceptible  moment  of  time,  then  fling 
themselves  into  the  wash  of  the  next  wave  and  are  carried  back 
to  sea.  For  about  an  hour  after  the  turn  of  the  tide  this  con¬ 
tinues,  thousands  upon  thousands  of  grunion  coming  up  onto 
the  beach,  leaving  the  water,  returning  to  it.  This  is  the  spawn¬ 
ing  act  of  the  species. 

During  the  brief  interval  between  successive  waves,  the  male 
and  female  have  come  together  in  the  wet  sand,  the  one  to  shed 
her  eggs,  the  other  to  fertilize  them.  When  the  parent  fish  return 
to  the  water,  they  have  left  behind  a  mass  of  eggs  buried  in  the 
sand.  Succeeding  waves  on  that  night  do  not  wash  out  the  eggs 
because  the  tide  is  already  ebbing.  The  waves  of  the  next  high 
tide  will  not  reach  them,  because  for  a  time  after  the  full  of  the 
moon  each  tide  will  halt  its  advance  a  little  lower  on  the  beach 
than  the  preceding  one.  The  eggs,  then,  will  be  undisturbed  for 


The  Restless  Sea

at  least  a  fortnight.  In  the  warm,  damp,  incubating  sand  they  un¬ 
dergo  their  development.  Within  two  weeks  the  magic  change 
from  fertilized  egg  to  larval  fishlet  is  completed,  the  perfectly 
formed  little  grunion  still  confined  within  the  membranes  of  the 
egg,  still  buried  in  the  sand,  waiting  for  release.  With  the  tides 
of  the  new  moon  it  comes.  Their  waves  wash  over  the  places 
where  the  little  masses  of  the  grunion  eggs  were  buried,  the  swirl 
and  rush  of  the  surf  stirring  the  sand  deeply.  As  the  sand  is 
washed  away,  and  the  eggs  feel  the  touch  of  the  cool  sea  water, 
the  membranes  rupture,  the  fishlets  hatch,  and  the  waves  that 
released  them  bear  them  away  to  the  sea. 

But  the  link  between  tide  and  living  creature  I  like  best  to  re¬ 
member  is  that  of  a  very  small  worm,  flat  of  body,  with  no  dis¬ 
tinction  of  appearance,  but  with  one  unforgettable  quality.  The 
name  of  this  worm  is  Convoluta  roscoffensis ,  and  it  lives  on  the 
sandy  beaches  of  northern  Brittany  and  the  Channel  Islands. 
Convoluta  has  entered  into  a  remarkable  partnership  with  a 
green  alga,  whose  cells  inhabit  the  body  of  the  worm  and  lend  to 
its  tissues  their  own  green  color.  The  worm  lives  entirely  on  the 
starchy  products  manufactured  by  its  plant  guest,  having  be¬ 
come  so  completely  dependent  upon  this  means  of  nutrition  that 
its  digestive  organs  have  degenerated.  In  order  that  the  algal  cells 
may  carry  on  their  function  of  photosynthesis  (which  is  depend¬ 
ent  upon  sunlight)  Convoluta  rises  from  the  damp  sands  of  the 
intertidal  zone  as  soon  as  the  tide  has  ebbed,  the  sand  becoming 
spotted  with  large  green  patches  composed  of  thousands  of  the 
worms.  For  the  several  hours  while  the  tide  is  out,  the  worms  lie 
thus  in  the  sun,  and  the  plants  manufacture  their  starches  and 
sugars;  but  when  the  tide  returns,  the  worms  must  again  sink 
into  the  sand  to  avoid  being  washed  away,  out  into  deep  water. 
So  the  whole  lifetime  of  the  worm  is  a  succession  of  movements 
conditioned  by  the  stages  of  the  tide — upward  into  sunshine  on 
the  ebb,  downward  on  the  flood. 

What  I  find  most  unforgettable  about  Convoluta  is  this: 
sometimes  it  happens  that  a  marine  biologist,  wishing  to  study 
some  related  problem,  will  transfer  a  whole  colony  of  the  worms 
into  the  laboratory,  there  to  establish  them  in  an  aquarium, 


The  Moving  Tides 


*59 


where  there  are  no  tides.  But  twice  each  day  Convoluta  rises  out 
of  the  sand  on  the  bottom  of  the  aquarium,  into  the  light  of  the 
sun.  And  twice  each  day  it  sinks  again  into  the  sand.  Without  a 
brain,  or  what  we  would  call  a  memory,  or  even  any  very  clear 
perception,  Convoluta  continues  to  live  out  its  life  in  this  alien 
place,  remembering,  in  every  fiber  of  its  small  green  body,  the 
tidal  rhythm  of  the  distant  sea.

AND  COLD  OUT  OF  THE  NORTH. 

— The  Book  of  Job 


W™  the  building  of  the  Panama  Canal  was  first  sug¬ 
gested,  the  project  was  severely  criticized  in  Europe.  The  French, 
especially,  complained  that  such  a  canal  would  allow  the  waters 
of  the  Equatorial  Current  to  escape  into  the  Pacific,  that  there 
would  then  be  no  Gulf  Stream,  and  that  the  winter  climate  of 
Europe  would  become  unbearably  frigid.  The  alarmed  French¬ 
men  were  completely  wrong  in  their  forecast  of  oceanographic 
events,  but  they  were  right  in  their  recognition  of  a  general  prin¬ 
ciple — the  close  relation  between  climate  and  the  pattern  of 
ocean  circulation. 

There  are  recurrent  schemes  for  deliberately  changing — or  at¬ 
tempting  to  change — the  pattern  of  the  currents  and  so  modify¬ 
ing  climate  at  will.  We  hear  of  projects  for  diverting  the  cold 
Oyashio  from  the  Asiatic  coast,  and  of  others  for  controlling  the 
Gulf  Stream.  About  1912  the  Congress  of  the  United  States  was 
asked  to  appropriate  money  to  build  a  jetty  from  Cape  Race 
eastward  across  the  Grand  Banks  to  obstruct  the  cold  water  flow¬ 
ing  south  from  the  Arctic.  Advocates  of  the  plan  believed  that

the  Gulf  Stream  would  then  swing  in  nearer  the  mainland  of 
the  northern  United  States  and  would  presumably  bring  us 
warmer  winters.  The  appropriation  was  not  granted.  Even  if 
the  money  had  been  provided,  there  is  little  reason  to  suppose 
that  engineers  then— or  later— could  have  succeeded  in  control¬ 
ling  the  sweep  of  the  ocean’s  currents.  And  fortunately  so,  for 
most  of  these  plans  would  have  effects  different  from  those 
popularly  expected.  Bringing  the  Gulf  Stream  closer  to  the 
American  east  coast,  for  example,  would  make  our  winters  worse 
instead  of  better.  Along  the  Atlantic  coast  of  North  America, 
the  prevailing  winds  blow  eastward,  across  the  land  toward  the 
sea.  The  air  masses  that  have  lain  over  the  Gulf  Stream  seldom 
reach  us.  But  the  Stream,  with  its  mass  of  warm  water,  does 
have  something  to  do  with  bringing  our  weather  to  us.  The  cold 
winds  of  winter  are  pushed  by  gravity  toward  the  low-pressure 
areas  over  the  warm  water.  The  winter  of  1916,  when  Stream 
temperatures  were  above  normal,  was  long  remembered  for  its 
cold  and  snowy  weather  along  the  east  coast.  If  we  could  move 
the  Stream  inshore,  the  result  in  winter  would  be  colder, 
stronger  winds  from  the  interior  of  the  continent— not  milder 
weather. 

But  if  the  eastern  North  American  climate  is  not  dominated 
by  the  Gulf  Stream,  it  is  far  otherwise  for  the  lands  lying  'down¬ 
stream/  From  the  Newfoundland  Banks,  as  we  have  seen,  the 
warm  water  of  the  Stream  drifts  eastward,  pushed  along  by  the 
prevailing  westerly  winds.  Almost  immediately,  however,  it  di¬ 
vides  into  several  branches.  One  flows  north  to  the  western  shore 
of  Greenland;  there  the  warm  water  attacks  the  ice  brought 
around  Cape  Farewell  by  the  East  Greenland  Current.  Another 
passes  to  the  southwest  coast  of  Iceland  and,  before  losing  itself 
in  arctic  waters,  brings  a  gentling  influence  to  the  southern 
shores  of  that  island.  But  the  main  branch  of  the  Gulf  Stream 
or  North  Atlantic  Drift  flows  eastward.  Soon  it  divides  again.  The 
southernmost  of  these  branches  turns  toward  Spain  and  Africa 
and  re-enters  the  Equatorial  Current.  The  northernmost  branch, 
hurried  eastward  by  the  winds  blowing  around  the  Icelandic 
'low/  piles  up  against  the  coast  of  Europe  the  warmest  water

found  at  comparable  latitudes  anywhere  in  the  world.  From  the 
Bay  of  Biscay  north  its  influence  is  felt.  And  as  the  current  rolls 
northeastward  along  the  Scandinavian  coast,  it  sends  off  many 
lateral  branches  that  curve  back  westward  to  bring  the  breath  of 
warm  water  to  the  arctic  islands  and  to  mingle  with  other  cur¬ 
rents  in  intricate  whirls  and  eddies.  The  west  coast  of  Spits¬ 
bergen,  warmed  by  one  of  these  lateral  streams,  is  bright  with 
flowers  in  the  arctic  summer;  the  east  coast,  with  its  polar  cur¬ 
rent,  remains  barren  and  forbidding.  Passing  around  the  North 
Cape,  the  warm  currents  keep  open  such  harbors  as  Hammerfest 
and  Murmansk,  although  Riga,  800  miles  farther  south  on  the 
shores  of  the  Baltic,  is  choked  with  ice.  Somewhere  in  the  Arctic 
Sea,  near  the  island  of  Novaya  Zemlya,  the  last  traces  of  Atlantic 
water  disappear,  losing  themselves  at  last  in  the  overwhelming 
sweep  of  the  icy  northern  sea. 

It  is  always  a  warm-water  current,  but  the  temperature  of  the 
Gulf  Stream  nevertheless  varies  from  year  to  year,  and  a  seem¬ 
ingly  slight  change  profoundly  affects  the  air  temperatures  of 
Europe.  The  British  meteorologist,  C.  E.  P.  Brooks,  compares 
the  North  Atlantic  to  'a  great  bath,  with  a  hot  tap  and  two  cold 
taps/  The  hot  tap  is  the  Gulf  Stream;  the  cold  taps  are  the  East 
Greenland  Current  and  the  Labrador  Current.  Both  the  volume 
and  the  temperature  of  the  hot-water  tap  vary.  The  cold  taps  are 
nearly  constant  in  temperature  but  vary  immensely  in  volume. 
The  adjustment  of  the  three  taps  determines  surface  tempera¬ 
tures  in  the  eastern  Atlantic  and  has  a  great  deal  to  do  with  the 
weather  of  Europe  and  with  happenings  in  arctic  seas.  A  very 
slight  winter  warming  of  the  eastern  Atlantic  temperatures 
means,  for  example,  that  the  snow  cover  of  northwestern  Europe 
will  melt  earlier,  that  there  will  be  an  earlier  thawing  of  the 
ground,  that  spring  plowing  may  begin  earlier,  and  that  the  har¬ 
vest  will  be  better.  It  means,  too,  that  there  will  be  relatively 
little  ice  near  Iceland  in  the  spring  and  that  the  amount  of  drift 
ice  in  the  Barents  Sea  will  diminish  a  year  or  two  later.  These 
relations  have  been  clearly  established  by  European  scientists. 
Some  day  long-range  weather  forecasts  for  the  continent  of  Eu¬ 
rope  will  probably  be  based  in  part  on  ocean  temperatures.  But 


1 66 


Man  and  the  Sea  about  Him 


at  present  there  are  no  means  for  collecting  the  temperatures 
over  a  large  enough  area,  at  frequent  enough  intervals.16 

For  the  globe  as  a  whole,  the  ocean  is  the  great  regulator,  the 
great  stabilizer  of  temperatures.  It  has  been  described  as  ‘a  sav¬ 
ings  bank  for  solar  energy,  receiving  deposits  in  seasons  of  ex¬ 
cessive  insolation  and  paying  them  back  in  seasons  of  want/ 
Without  the  ocean,  our  world  would  be  visited  by  unthinkably 
harsh  extremes  of  temperature.  For  the  water  that  covers  three- 
fourths  of  the  earth's  surface  with  an  enveloping  mantle  is  a  sub¬ 
stance  of  remarkable  qualities.  It  is  an  excellent  absorber  and 
radiator  of  heat.  Because  of  its  enormous  heat  capacity,  the 
ocean  can  absorb  a  great  deal  of  heat  from  the  sun  without  be¬ 
coming  what  we  would  consider  'hot,'  or  it  can  lose  much  of  its 
heat  without  becoming  ‘cold.' 

Through  the  agency  of  ocean  currents,  heat  and  cold  may  be 
distributed  over  thousands  of  miles.  It  is  possible  to  follow  the 
course  of  a  mass  of  warm  water  that  originates  in  the  trade-wind 
belt  of  the  Southern  Hemisphere  and  remains  recognizable  for  a 
year  and  a  half,  through  a  course  of  more  than  7000  miles.  This 
redistributing  function  of  the  ocean  tends  to  make  up  for  the  un¬ 
even  heating  of  the  globe  by  the  sun.  As  it  is,  ocean  currents 
carry  hot  equatorial  water  toward  the  poles  and  return  cold  water 
equator-ward  by  such  surface  drifts  as  the  Labrador  Current  and 
Oyashio,  and  even  more  importantly  by  deep  currents.  The  re¬ 
distribution  of  heat  for  the  whole  earth  is  accomplished  about 
half  by  the  ocean  currents,  and  half  by  the  winds. 

At  that  thin  interface  between  the  ocean  of  water  and  the 
ocean  of  overlying  air,  lying  as  they  do  in  direct  contact  over  by 
far  the  greater  part  of  the  earth,  there  are  continuous  inter¬ 
actions  of  tremendous  importance. 

The  atmosphere  warms  or  cools  the  ocean.  It  receives  vapors 
through  evaporation,  leaving  most  of  the  salts  in  the  sea  and  so 
increasing  the  salinity  of  the  water.  With  the  changing  weight  of 
that  whole  mass  of  air  that  envelops  the  earth,  the  atmosphere 
brings  variable  pressure  to  bear  on  the  surface  of  the  sea,  which 
is  depressed  under  areas  of  high  pressure  and  springs  up  in  com¬ 
pensation  under  the  atmospheric  lows.  With  the  moving  force 


h 


The  Global  Thermostat 


167 

of  the  winds,  the  air  grips  the  surface  of  the  ocean  and  raises  it 
into  waves,  drives  the  currents  onward,  lowers  sea  levels  on  wind¬ 
ward  shores,  and  raises  it  on  lee  shores. 

But  even  more  does  the  ocean  dominate  the  air.  Its  effect  on 
the  temperature  and  humidity  of  the  atmosphere  is  far  greater 
than  the  small  transfer  of  heat  from  air  to  sea.  It  takes  3000 
times  as  much  heat  to  warm  a  given  volume  of  water  i°  as  to 
warm  an  equal  volume  of  air  by  the  same  amount.  The  heat  lost 
by  a  cubic  meter  of  water  on  cooling  i°  C.  would  raise  the  tem¬ 
perature  of  3000  cubic  meters  of  air  by  the  same  amount.  Or 
to  use  another  example,  a  layer  of  water  a  meter  deep,  on  cooling 
.i°  could  warm  a  layer  of  air  33  meters  thick  by  io°.  The  tem¬ 
perature  of  the  air  is  intimately  related  to  atmospheric  pressure. 
Where  the  air  is  cold,  pressure  tends  to  be  high;  warm  air  favors 
low  pressures.  The  transfer  of  heat  between  ocean  and  air  there¬ 
fore  alters  the  belts  of  high  and  low  pressure;  this  profoundly 
affects  the  direction  and  strength  of  the  winds  and  directs  the 
storms  on  their  paths. 

There  are  six  more  or  less  permanent  centers  of  high  pressure 
over  the  oceans,  three  in  each  hemisphere.  Not  only  do  these 
areas  play  a  controlling  part  in  the  climate  of  surrounding  lands, 
but  they  affect  the  whole  world  because  they  are  the  birthplaces 
of  most  of  the  dominant  winds  of  the  globe.  The  trade  winds 
originate  in  high-pressure  belts  of  the  Northern  and  Southern 
hemispheres.  Over  all  the  vast  extent  of  ocean  across  which  they 
blow,  these  great  winds  retain  their  identity;  it  is  only  over  the 
continents  that  they  become  interrupted,  confused,  and  modi¬ 
fied. 

In  other  ocean  areas  there  are  belts  of  low  pressure,  which  de¬ 
velop,  especially  in  winter,  over  waters  that  are  then  warmer 
than  the  surrounding  lands.  Traveling  barometric  depressions  or 
cyclonic  storms  are  attracted  by  these  areas;  they  move  rapidly 
across  them  or  skirt  around  their  edges.  So  winter  storms  take  a 
path  across  the  Icelandic  ‘low’  and  over  the  Shetlands  and  Ork¬ 
neys  into  the  North  Sea  and  the  Norwegian  Sea;  other  storms  are 
directed  by  still  other  low-pressure  areas  over  the  Skagerrak  and 
the  Baltic  into  the  interior  of  Europe.  Perhaps  more  than  any 


i68

other  condition,  the  low-pressure  area  over  the  warm  water  south 
of  Iceland  dominates  the  winter  climate  of  Europe. 

And  most  of  the  rains  that  fall  on  sea  and  land  alike  were 
raised  from  the  sea.  They  are  carried  as  vapor  in  the  winds,  and 
then  with  change  of  temperature  the  rains  fall.  Most  of  the  Eu¬ 
ropean  rain  comes  from  evaporation  of  Atlantic  water.  In  the 
United  States,  vapor  and  warm  air  from  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  and 
the  tropical  waters  of  the  western  Atlantic  ride  the  winds  up  the 
wide  valley  of  the  Mississippi  and  provide  rains  for  much  of  the 
eastern  part  of  North  America. 

Whether  any  place  will  know  the  harsh  extremes  of  a  conti¬ 
nental  climate  or  the  moderating  effect  of  the  sea  depends  less 
on  its  nearness  to  the  ocean  than  on  the  pattern  of  currents  and 
winds  and  the  relief  of  the  continents.  The  east  coast  of  North 
America  receives  little  benefit  from  the  sea,  because  the  prevail¬ 
ing  winds  are  from  the  west.  The  Pacific  coast,  on  the  other 
hand,  lies  in  the  path  of  the  westerly  winds  that  have  blown 
across  thousands  of  miles  of  ocean.  The  moist  breath  of  the  Pa¬ 
cific  brings  climatic  mildness  and  creates  the  dense  rain  forests 
of  British  Columbia,  Washington,  and  Oregon;  but  its  full  influ¬ 
ence  is  largely  restricted  to  a  narrow  strip  by  the  coast  ranges 
that  follow  a  course  parallel  to  the  sea.  Europe,  in  contrast,  is 
wide  open  to  the  sea,  and  'Atlantic  weather’  carries  hundreds  of 
miles  into  the  interior. 

By  a  seeming  paradox,  there  are  parts  of  the  world  that  owe 
their  desert  dryness  to  their  nearness  to  the  ocean.  The  aridity 
of  the  Atacama  and  Kalahari  deserts  is  curiously  related  to  the 
sea.  Wherever  such  marine  deserts  occur,  there  is  found  this 
combination  of  circumstances:  a  western  coast  in  the  path  of  the 
prevailing  winds,  and  a  cold  coastwise  current.  So  on  the  west 
coast  of  South  America  the  cold  Humboldt  streams  northward 
off  the  shores  of  Chile  and  Peru— the  great  return  flow  of  Pacific 
waters  seeking  the  equator.  The  Humboldt,  it  will  be  remem¬ 
bered,  is  cold  because  it  is  continuously  being  reinforced  by  the 
upwelling  of  deeper  water.  The  presence  of  this  cold  water  off¬ 
shore  helps  create  the  aridity  of  the  region.  The  onshore  breezes 
that  push  in  toward  the  hot  land  in  the  afternoons  are  formed  of 


The  Global  Thermostat

cool  air  that  has  lain  over  a  cool  sea.  As  they  reach  the  land  they 
are  forced  to  rise  into  the  high  coastal  mountains— the  ascent 
cooling  them  more  than  the  land  can  warm  them.  So  there  is 
little  condensation  of  water  vapor,  and  although  the  cloud  banks 
and  the  fogs  forever  seem  to  promise  rain,  the  promise  is  not  ful¬ 
filled  so  long  as  the  Humboldt  rolls  on  its  accustomed  course 
along  these  shores.  On  the  stretch  from  Arica  to  Caldera  there 
is  normally  less  than  an  inch  of  rain  in  a  year.  It  is  a  beautifully 
balanced  system— as  long  as  it  remains  in  balance.  What  hap¬ 
pens  when  the  Humboldt  is  temporarily  displaced  is  nothing 
short  of  catastrophic. 

At  irregular  intervals  the  Humboldt  is  deflected  away  from  the 
South  American  continent  by  a  warm  current  of  tropical  water 
that  comes  down  from  the  north.  These  are  years  of  disaster. 
The  whole  economy  of  the  area  is  adjusted  to  the  normal  aridity 
of  climate.  In  the  years  of  El  Nino,  as  the  warm  current  is 
called,  torrential  rains  fall— the  downpouring  rains  of  the  equa¬ 
torial  regions  let  loose  upon  the  dust-dry  hillsides  of  the  Peru¬ 
vian  coast.  The  soil  washes  away,  the  mud  huts  literally  dissolve 
and  collapse,  crops  are  destroyed.  Even  worse  things  happen  at 
sea.  The  cold-water  fauna  of  the  Humboldt  sickens  and  dies  in 
the  warm  water,  and  the  birds  that  fish  the  cold  sea  for  a  living 
must  either  migrate  or  starve. 

Those  parts  of  the  coast  of  Africa  that  are  bathed  by  the  cool 
Benguela  Current  also  lie  between  mountains  and  sea.  The 
easterly  winds  are  dry,  descending  winds,  and  the  cool  breezes 
from  the  sea  have  their  moisture  capacity  increased  by  contact 
with  the  hot  land.  Mists  form  over  the  cold  waters  and  roll  in 
over  the  coast,  but  in  a  whole  year  the  rainfall  is  the  meagerest 
token.  The  mean  rainfall  at  Swakopmund  in  Walvis  Bay  is  0.7 
inches  a  year.  But  again  this  is  true  only  as  long  as  the  Benguela 
holds  sway  along  the  coast,  for  there  are  times  when  the  cold 
stream  falters  as  does  the  Humboldt,  and  here  also  these  are 
years  of  disaster. 

The  transforming  influence  of  the  sea  is  portrayed  with  beau¬ 
tiful  clarity  in  the  striking  differences  between  the  Arctic  and 
Antarctic  regions.  As  everyone  knows,  the  Arctic  is  a  nearly

landlocked  sea;  the  Antarctic,  a  continent  surrounded  by  ocean. 
Whether  this  global  balancing  of  a  land  pole  against  a  water 
pole  has  a  deep  significance  in  the  physics  of  the  earth  is  un¬ 
certain;  but  the  bearing  of  the  fact  on  the  climates  of  the  two 
regions  is  plainly  evident. 

The  ice-covered  Antarctic  continent,  bathed  by  seas  of  uni¬ 
form  coldness,  is  in  the  grip  of  the  polar  anticyclone.  High  winds 
blow  from  the  land  and  repel  any  warming  influence  that  might 
seek  to  penetrate  it.  The  mean  temperature  of  this  bitter  world 
is  never  above  the  freezing  point.  On  exposed  rocks  the  lichens 
grow,  covering  the  barrenness  of  cliffs  with  their  gray  or  orange 
growths,  and  here  and  there  over  the  snow  is  the  red  dust  of  the 
hardier  algae.  Mosses  hide  in  the  valleys  and  crevices  less  ex¬ 
posed  to  the  winds,  but  of  the  higher  plants  only  a  few  impov¬ 
erished  stands  of  grasses  have  managed  to  invade  this  land. 
There  are  no  land  mammals;  the  fauna  of  the  Antarctic  conti¬ 
nent  consists  only  of  birds,  wingless  mosquitoes,  a  few  flies,  and 
microscopic  mites. 

In  sharp  contrast  are  the  arctic  summers,  where  the  tundra  is 
bright  with  many-colored  flowers.  Everywhere  except  on  the 
Greenland  icecap  and  some  of  the  arctic  islands,  summer  tem¬ 
peratures  are  high  enough  for  the  growth  of  plants,  packing  a 
year’s  development  into  the  short,  warm,  arctic  summer.  The 
polar  limit  of  plant  growth  is  set  not  by  latitude,  but  by  the  sea. 
For  the  influence  of  the  warm  Atlantic  penetrates  strongly 
within  the  Arctic  Sea,  entering,  as  we  have  seen,  through  the  one 
large  break  in  the  land  girdle,  the  Greenland  Sea.  But  the 
streams  of  warm  Atlantic  water  that  enter  the  icy  northern  seas 
bring  the  gentling  touch  that  makes  the  Arctic,  in  climate  as 
well  as  in  geography,  a  world  apart  from  the  Antarctic. 

So,  day  by  day  and  season  by  season,  the  ocean  dominates  the 
world  s  climate.  Can  it  also  be  an  agent  in  bringing  about  the 
long-period  swings  of  climatic  change  that  we  know  have  oc¬ 
curred  throughout  the  long  history  of  the  earth— the  alternating 
periods  of  heat  and  cold,  of  drought  and  flood?  There  is  a  fasci¬ 
nating  theory  that  it  can.  This  theory  links  events  in  the  deep, 
hidden  places  of  the  ocean  with  the  cyclic  changes  of  climate

and  their  effects  on  human  history.  It  was  developed  by  the  dis¬ 
tinguished  Swedish  oceanographer,  Otto  Pettersson,  whose  al¬ 
most  century-long  life  closed  in  1941.  In  many  papers,  Pettersson 
presented  the  different  facets  of  his  theory  as  he  pieced  it  to¬ 
gether,  bit  by  bit.  Many  of  his  fellow  scientists  were  impressed, 
others  doubted.  In  those  days  few  men  could  conceive  of  the 
dynamics  of  water  movements  in  the  deep  sea.  Now  the  theory 
is  being  re-examined  in  the  light  of  modern  oceanography  and 
meteorology,  and  only  recently  C.  E.  P.  Brooks  said,  'It  seems 
that  there  is  good  support  for  Pettersson’s  theory  as  well  as  for 
that  of  solar  activity,  and  that  the  actual  variations  of  climate 
since  about  3000  b.c.  may  have  been  to  a  large  extent  the  result 
of  these  two  agents.’ 

To  review  the  Pettersson  theory  is  to  review  also  a  pageant  of 
human  history,  of  men  and  nations  in  the  control  of  elemental 
forces  whose  nature  they  never  understood  and  whose  very  exist¬ 
ence  they  never  recognized.  Pettersson’s  work  was  perhaps  a 
natural  outcome  of  the  circumstances  of  his  life.  He  was  born — 
as  he  died  93  years  later— -on  the  shores  of  the  Baltic,  a  sea  of 
complex  and  wonderful  hydrography.  In  his  laboratory  atop  a 
sheer  cliff  overlooking  the  deep  waters  of  the  Gulmarfiord,  in¬ 
struments  recorded  strange  phenomena  in  the  depths  of  this 
gateway  to  the  Baltic.  As  the  ocean  water  presses  in  toward  that 
inland  sea  it  dips  down  and  lets  the  fresh  surface  water  roll  out 
above  it;  and  at  that  deep  level  where  salt  and  fresh  water  come 
into  contact  there  is  a  sharp  layer  of  discontinuity,  like  the  sur¬ 
face  film  between  water  and  air.  Each  day  Pettersson’s  instru¬ 
ments  revealed  a  strong,  pulsing  movement  of  that  deep  layer 
the  pressing  inward  of  great  submarine  waves,  of  moving  moun¬ 
tains  of  water.  The  movement  was  strongest  every  twelfth  hour 
of  the  day,  and  between  the  12-hour  intervals  it  subsided.  Pet¬ 
tersson  soon  established  a  link  between  these  submarine  waves 
and  the  daily  tides.  ‘Moon  waves,’  he  called  them,  and  as  he 
measured  their  height  and  timed  their  pulsing  beat  through  the 
months  and  years,  their  relation  to  the  ever-changing  cycles  of 
the  tides  became  crystal  clear. 

Some  of  these  deep  waves  of  the  Gulmarfiord  were  giants

nearly  100  feet  high.  Pettersson  believed  they  were  formed  by 
the  impact  of  the  oceanic  tide  wave  on  the  submarine  ridges  of 
the  North  Atlantic,  as  though  the  waters  moving  to  the  pull  of 
the  sun  and  moon,  far  down  in  the  lower  levels  of  the  sea,  broke 
and  spilled  over  in  mountains  of  highly  saline  water  to  enter  the 
fiords  and  sounds  of  the  coast. 

From  the  submarine  tide  waves,  Pettersson's  mind  moved  logi¬ 
cally  to  another  problem— the  changing  fortunes  of  the  Swedish 
herring  fishery.  His  native  Bohuslan  had  been  the  site  of  the 
great  Hanseatic  herring  fisheries  of  the  Middle  Ages.  All  through 
the  thirteenth,  fourteenth,  and  fifteenth  centuries  this  great  sea 
fishery  was  pursued  in  the  Sund  and  the  Belts,  the  narrow  pas¬ 
sageways  into  the  Baltic.  The  towns  of  Skanor  and  Falsterbo 
knew  unheard-of  prosperity,  for  there  seemed  no  end  of  the 
silvery,  wealth-bringing  fish.  Then  suddenly  the  fishery  ceased, 
for  the  herring  withdrew  into  the  North  Sea  and  came  no  more 
into  the  gateways  of  the  Baltic— this  to  the  enrichment  of  Hol¬ 
land  and  the  impoverishment  of  Sweden.  Why  did  the  herring 
cease  to  come?  Pettersson  thought  he  knew,  and  the  reason  was 
intimately  related  to  that  moving  pen  in  his  laboratory,  the  pen 
that  traced  on  a  revolving  drum  the  movements  of  the  sub¬ 
marine  waves  far  down  in  the  depths  of  Gulmarfiord. 

He  had  found  that  the  submarine  waves  varied  in  height  and 
power  as  the  tide-producing  power  of  the  moon  and  sun  varied. 
From  astronomical  calculations  he  learned  that  the  tides  must 
have  been  at  their  greatest  strength  during  the  closing  centuries 
of  the  Middle  Ages — those  centuries  when  the  Baltic  herring  fish¬ 
ery  was  flourishing.  Then  sun,  moon,  and  earth  came  into  such 
a  position  at  the  time  of  the  winter  solstice  that  they  exerted  the 
greatest  possible  attracting  force  upon  the  sea.  Only  about  every 
eighteen  centuries  do  the  heavenly  bodies  assume  this  particular 
relation.  But  in  that  period  of  the  Middle  Ages,  the  great  under¬ 
water  waves  pressed  with  unusual  force  into  the  narrow  passages 
to  the  Baltic,  and  with  the  water  mountains'  went  the  herring 
shoals.  Later,  when  the  tides  became  weaker,  the  herring  re¬ 
mained  outside  the  Baltic,  in  the  North  Sea. 

Then  Pettersson  realized  another  fact  of  extreme  significance 


The  Global  Thermostat 


m 

— that  those  centuries  of  great  tides  had  been  a  period  of  ‘star¬ 
tling  and  unusual  occurrences'  in  the  world  of  nature.  Polar  ice 
blocked  much  of  the  North  Atlantic.  The  coasts  of  the  North 
Sea  and  the  Baltic  were  laid  waste  by  violent  storm  floods.  The 
winters  were  of  ‘unexplained  severity'  and  in  consequence  of  the 
climatic  rigors  political  and  economic  catastrophes  occurred  all 
over  the  populated  regions  of  the  earth.  Could  there  be  a  con¬ 
nection  between  these  events  and  those  moving  mountains  of 
unseen  water?  Could  the  deep  tides  affect  the  lives  of  men  as 
well  as  of  herring? 

From  this  germ  of  an  idea,  Pettersson's  fertile  mind  evolved  a 
theory  of  climatic  variation,  which  he  set  forth  in  1912  in  an  ex¬ 
traordinarily  interesting  document  called  Climatic  Variations  in 
Historic  and  Prehistoric  Time*  Marshalling  scientific,  historic, 
and  literary  evidence,  he  showed  that  there  are  alternating  peri¬ 
ods  of  mild  and  severe  climates  which  correspond  to  the  long- 
period  cycles  of  the  oceanic  tides.  The  world's  most  recent 
period  of  maximum  tides,  and  most  rigorous  climate,  occurred 
about  1433,  its  effect  being  felt,  however,  for  several  centuries 
before  and  after  that  year.  The  minimum  tidal  effect  prevailed 
about  a.d.  550,  and  it  will  occur  again  about  the  year  2400. 

During  the  latest  period  of  benevolent  climate,  snow  and  ice 
were  little  known  on  the  coast  of  Europe  and  in  the  seas  about 
Iceland  and  Greenland.  Then  the  Vikings  sailed  freely  over 
northern  seas,  monks  went  back  and  forth  between  Ireland  and 
‘Thyle’  or  Iceland,  and  there  was  easy  intercourse  between  Great 
Britain  and  the  Scandinavian  countries.  When  Eric  the  Red  voy¬ 
aged  to  Greenland,  according  to  the  Sagas,  he  ‘came  from  the 
sea  to  land  at  the  middle  glacier — from  thence  he  went  south 
along  the  coast  to  see  if  the  land  was  habitable.  The  first  year 
he  wintered  on  Erik’s  Island  . . .'  This  was  probably  in  the  year 
984.  There  is  no  mention  in  the  Sagas  that  Eric  was  hampered 
by  drift  ice  in  the  several  years  of  his  exploration  of  the  island; 
nor  is  there  mention  of  drift  ice  anywhere  about  Greenland,  or 
between  Greenland  and  Wineland.  Eric's  route  as  described  in 
the  Sagas — proceeding  directly  west  from  Iceland  and  then  down 

*  Svenska  Hydrog.-Biol.  Komm.  Skrifter,  No.  5,  1912. 


*74  Man  and  the  Sea  about  Him 

the  east  coast  of  Greenland — is  one  that  would  have  been  im¬ 
possible  during  recent  centuries.  In  the  thirteenth  century  the 
Sagas  contain  for  the  first  time  a  warning  that  those  who  sail 
for  Greenland  should  not  make  the  coast  too  directly  west  of 
Iceland  on  account  of  the  ice  in  the  sea,  but  no  new  route  is 
then  recommended.  At  the  end  of  the  fourteenth  century,  how¬ 
ever,  the  old  sailing  route  was  abandoned  and  new  sailing  di¬ 
rections  were  given  for  a  more  southwesterly  course  that  would 
avoid  the  ice. 

The  early  Sagas  spoke,  too,  of  the  abundant  fruit  of  excellent 
quality  growing  in  Greenland,  and  of  the  number  of  cattle  that 
could  be  pastured  there.  The  Norwegian  settlements  were  lo¬ 
cated  in  places  that  are  now  at  the  foot  of  glaciers.  There  are 
Eskimo  legends  of  old  houses  and  churches  buried  under  the  ice. 
The  Danish  Archaeological  Expedition  sent  out  by  the  National 
Museum  of  Copenhagen  was  never  able  to  find  all  of  the  villages 
mentioned  in  the  old  records.  But  its  excavations  indicated 
clearly  that  the  colonists  lived  in  a  climate  definitely  milder  than 
the  present  one. 

But  these  bland  climatic  conditions  began  to  deteriorate  in  the 
thirteenth  century.  The  Eskimos  began  to  make  troublesome 
raids,  perhaps  because  their  northern  sealing  grounds  were  frozen 
over  and  they  were  hungry.  They  attacked  the  western  settle¬ 
ment  near  the  present  Ameralik  Fiord,  and  when  an  official  mis¬ 
sion  went  out  from  the  eastern  colony  about  1342,  not  a  single 
colonist  could  be  found — only  a  few  cattle  remained.  The  eastern 
settlement  was  wiped  out  some  time  after  1418  and  the  houses 
and  churches  destroyed  by  fire.  Perhaps  the  fate  of  the  Green¬ 
land  colonies  was  in  part  due  to  the  fact  that  ships  from  Iceland 
and  Europe  were  finding  it  increasingly  difficult  to  reach  Green¬ 
land,  and  the  colonists  had  to  be  left  to  their  own  resources. 

The  climatic  rigors  experienced  in  Greenland  in  the  thir¬ 
teenth  and  fourteenth  centuries  were  felt  also  in  Europe  in  a 
series  of  unusual  events  and  extraordinary  catastrophes.  The 
seacoast  of  Holland  was  devastated  by  storm  floods.  Old  Ice¬ 
landic  records  say  that,  in  the  winters  of  the  early  1 300’s,  packs 
of  wolves  crossed  on  the  ice  from  Norway  to  Denmark.  The  en-

tire  Baltic  froze  over,  forming  a  bridge  of  solid  ice  between 
Sweden  and  the  Danish  islands.  Pedestrians  and  carriages 
crossed  the  frozen  sea  and  hostelries  were  put  up  on  the  ice  to 
accommodate  them.  The  freezing  of  the  Baltic  seems  to  have 
shifted  the  course  of  storms  originating  in  the  low-pressure  belt 
south  of  Iceland.  In  southern  Europe,  as  a  result,  there  were 
unusual  storms,  crop  failures,  famine,  and  distress.  Icelandic 
literature  abounds  in  tales  of  volcanic  eruptions  and  other  vio¬ 
lent  natural  catastrophes  that  occurred  during  the  fourteenth 
century. 

What  of  the  previous  era  of  cold  and  storms,  which  should 
have  occurred  about  the  third  or  fourth  century  b.c.,  according 
to  the  tidal  theory?  There  are  shadowy  hints  in  early  literature 
and  folklore.  The  dark  and  brooding  poetry  of  the  Edda  deals 
with  a  great  catastrophe,  the  Fimbul-winter  or  Gotterdamme- 
rung,  when  frost  and  snow  ruled  the  world  for  generations. 
When  Pytheas  journeyed  to  the  seas  north  of  Iceland  in  330  b.c., 
he  spoke  of  the  mare  pigrum ,  a  sluggish,  congealed  sea.  Early 
history  contains  striking  suggestions  that  the  restless  movements 
of  the  tribes  of  northern  Europe— the  southward  migrations  of 
the  'barbarians’  who  shook  the  power  of  Rome— coincided  with 
periods  of  storms,  floods,  and  other  climatic  catastrophes  that 
forced  their  migrations.  Large-scale  inundations  of  the  sea  de¬ 
stroyed  the  homelands  of  the  Teutons  and  Cimbrians  in  Jutland 
and  sent  them  southward  into  Gaul.  Tradition  among  the 
Druids  said  that  their  ancestors  had  been  expelled  from  their 
lands  on  the  far  side  of  the  Rhine  by  enemy  tribes  and  by  'a 
great  invasion  of  the  ocean.’  And  about  the  year  700  b.c.  the 
trade  routes  for  amber,  found  on  the  coasts  of  the  North  Sea, 
were  suddenly  shifted  to  the  east.  The  old  route  came  down 
along  the  Elbe,  the  Weser,  and  the  Danube,  through  the  Bren¬ 
ner  Pass  to  Italy.  The  new  route  followed  the  Vistula,  suggesting 
that  the  source  of  supply  was  then  the  Baltic.  Perhaps  storm 
floods  had  destroyed  the  earlier  amber  districts,  as  they  invaded 
these  same  regions  eighteen  centuries  later. 

All  these  ancient  records  of  climatic  variations  seemed  to  Pet- 
tersson  an  indication  that  cyclic  changes  in  the  oceanic  circula-

tion  and  in  the  conditions  of  the  Atlantic  had  occurred.  ‘No 
geologic  alteration  that  could  influence  the  climate  has  oc¬ 
curred  for  the  past  six  or  seven  centuries/  he  wrote.  The  very 
nature  of  these  phenomena— floods,  inundations,  ice  blockades 
—suggested  to  him  a  dislocation  of  the  oceanic  circulation. 
Applying  the  discoveries  in  his  laboratory  on  Gulmarfiord,  he 
believed  that  the  climatic  changes  were  brought  about  as  the 
tide-induced  submarine  waves  disturbed  the  deep  waters  of  polar 
seas.  Although  tidal  movements  are  often  weak  at  the  surface  of 
these  seas,  they  set  up  strong  pulsations  at  the  submarine  bound¬ 
aries,  where  there  is  a  layer  of  comparatively  fresh,  cold  water 
lying  upon  a  layer  of  salty,  warmer  water.  In  the  years  or  the 
centuries  of  strong  tidal  forces,  unusual  quantities  of  warm  At¬ 
lantic  water  press  into  the  Arctic  Sea  at  deep  levels,  moving  in 
under  the  ice.  Then  thousands  of  square  miles  of  ice  that  nor¬ 
mally  remain  solidly  frozen  undergo  partial  thawing  and  break 
up.  Drift  ice,  in  extraordinary  volume,  enters  the  Labrador  Cur¬ 
rent  and  is  carried  southward  into  the  Atlantic.  This  changes  the 
pattern  of  surface  circulation,  which  is  so  intimately  related  to 
the  winds,  the  rainfall,  and  the  air  temperatures.  For  the  drift 
ice  then  attacks  the  Gulf  Stream  south  of  Newfoundland  and 
sends  it  on  a  more  easterly  course,  deflecting  the  streams  of  warm 
surface  water  that  usually  bring  a  softening  effect  to  the  climate 
of  Greenland,  Iceland,  Spitsbergen,  and  northern  Europe.  The 
position  of  the  low-pressure  belt  south  of  Iceland  is  also  shifted, 
with  further  direct  effect  on  European  climate. 

Although  the  really  catastrophic  disturbances  of  the  polar 
regime  come  only  every  eighteen  centuries,  according  to  Pet- 
tersson,  there  are  also  rhythmically  occurring  periods  that  fall  at 
varying  intervals— for  example,  every  9,  18,  or  36  years.  These 
correspond  to  other  tidal  cycles.  They  produce  climatic  varia¬ 
tions  of  shorter  period  and  of  less  drastic  nature. 

The  year  1903,  for  instance,  was  memorable  for  its  outbursts 
of  polar  ice  in  the  Arctic  and  for  the  repercussions  on  Scandi¬ 
navian  fisheries.  There  was  ‘a  general  failure  of  cod,  herring,  and 
other  fish  along  the  coast  from  Finmarken  and  Lofoten  to  the 
Skagerrak  and  Kattegat.  The  greater  part  of  the  Barents  Sea  was 


The  Global  Thermostat

covered  with  pack  ice  up  to  May,  the  ice  border  approaching 
closer  to  the  Murman  and  Finmarken  coasts  than  ever  before. 
Herds  of  arctic  seals  visited  these  coasts,  and  some  species  of  the 
arctic  whitefish  extended  their  migrations  to  the  Christiana 
Fiord  and  even  entered  into  the  Baltic/  This  outbreak  of  ice 
came  in  a  year  when  earth,  moon,  and  sun  were  in  a  relative 
position  that  gives  a  secondary  maximum  of  the  tide-producing 
forces.  The  similar  constellation  of  1912  was  another  great  ice 
year  in  the  Labrador  Current— a  year  that  brought  the  disaster 
of  the  Titanic. 

Now  in  our  own  lifetime  we  are  witnessing  a  startling  altera¬ 
tion  of  climate,  and  it  is  intriguing  to  apply  Otto  Pettersson’s 
ideas  as  a  possible  explanation.  It  is  now  established  beyond 
question  that  a  definite  change  in  the  arctic  climate  set  in  about 
1900,  that  it  became  astonishingly  marked  about  1930,  and  that 
it  is  now  spreading  into  sub-arctic  and  temperate  regions.  The 
frigid  top  of  the  world  is  very  clearly  warming  up. 

The  trend  toward  a  milder  climate  in  the  Arctic  is  perhaps 
most  strikingly  apparent  in  the  greater  ease  of  navigation  in  the 
North  Atlantic  and  the  Arctic  Sea.  In  1932,  for  example,  the 
Knipowitsch  sailed  around  Franz  Josef  Land  for  the  first  time  in 
the  history  of  arctic  voyaging.  And  three  years  later  the  Russian 
ice-breaker  Sadko  went  from  the  northern  tip  of  Novaya  Zemlya 
to  a  point  north  of  Severnaya  Zemlya  (Northern  Land)  and 
thence  to  82°  41'  north  latitude — the  northernmost  point  ever 
reached  by  a  ship  under  its  own  power. 

In  1940  the  whole  northern  coast  of  Europe  and  Asia  was  re¬ 
markably  free  from  ice  during  the  summer  months,  and  more 
than  100  vessels  engaged  in  trade  via  the  arctic  routes.  In  1942 
a  vessel  unloaded  supplies  at  the  west  Greenland  port  of  Uper- 
nivik  (latitude  720  43'  N)  during  Christmas  week  fin  almost 
complete  winter  darkness/  During  the  ’forties  the  season  for 
shipping  coal  from  West  Spitsbergen  ports  lengthened  to  seven 
months,  compared  with  three  at  the  beginning  of  the  century. 
The  season  when  pack  ice  lies  about  Iceland  became  shorter  by 
about  two  months  than  it  was  a  century  ago.  Drift  ice  in  the 
Russian  sector  of  the  Arctic  Sea  decreased  by  a  million  square

kilometers  between  1924  and  1944,  an^  Laptev  Sea  two 

islands  of  fossil  ice  melted  away  completely,  their  position  being 
marked  by  submarine  shoals. 

Activities  in  the  nonhuman  world  also  reflect  the  warming  of 
the  Arctic— the  changed  habits  and  migrations  of  many  fishes, 
birds,  land  mammals,  and  whales. 

Many  new  birds  are  appearing  in  far  northern  lands  for  the 
first  time  in  our  records.  The  long  list  of  southern  visitors — birds 
never  reported  in  Greenland  before  1920 — includes  the  American 
velvet  scoter,  the  greater  yellowlegs,  American  avocet,  black- 
browed  albatross,  northern  cliff  swallow,  ovenbird,  common 
crossbill,  Baltimore  oriole,  and  Canada  warbler.  Some  high-arctic 
forms,  which  thrive  in  cold  climates,  have  shown  their  distaste 
for  the  warmer  temperatures  by  visiting  Greenland  in  sharply 
decreasing  numbers.  Such  abstainers  include  the  northern 
horned  lark,  the  grey  plover,  and  the  pectoral  sandpiper.  Iceland, 
too,  has  had  an  extraordinary  number  of  boreal  and  even  sub¬ 
tropical  avian  visitors  since  1935,  coming  from  both  America 
and  Europe.  Wood  warblers,  skylarks,  and  Siberian  rubythroats, 
scarlet  grosbeaks,  pipits,  and  thrushes  now  provide  exciting  fare 
for  Icelandic  bird  watchers. 

When  the  cod  first  appeared  at  Angmagssalik  in  Greenland 
in  1912,  it  was  a  new  and  strange  fish  to  the  Eskimos  and  Danes. 
Within  their  memory  it  had  never  before  appeared  on  the  east 
coast  of  the  island.  But  they  began  to  catch  it,  and  by  the  1930’s 
it  supported  so  substantial  a  fishery  in  the  area  that  the  natives 
had  become  dependent  upon  it  for  food.  They  were  also  using 
its  oil  as  fuel  for  their  lamps  and  to  heat  their  houses. 

On  the  west  coast  of  Greenland,  too,  the  cod  was  a  rarity  at 
the  turn  of  the  century,  although  there  was  a  small  fishery,  tak¬ 
ing  about  300  tons  a  year,  at  a  few  places  on  the  southwest  coast. 
About  1919  the  cod  began  to  move  north  along  the  west  Green¬ 
land  coast  and  to  become  more  abundant.  The  center  of  the 
fishery  has  moved  300  miles  farther  north,  and  the  catch  is  now 
about  1 3,000  tons  a  year. 

Other  fishes  seldom  or  never  before  reported  in  Greenland 
have  appeared  there.  The  coalfish  or  green  cod  is  a  European  fish

so  foreign  to  Greenland  waters  that  when  two  of  them  were 
caught  in  1831  they  were  promptly  preserved  in  salt  and  sent  to 
the  Copenhagen  Zoological  Museum.  But  since  1924  this  fish 
has  often  been  found  among  the  cod  shoals.  The  haddock,  cusk, 
and  ling,  unknown  in  Greenland  waters  until  about  1930,  arc 
now  taken  regularly.  Iceland,  too,  has  strange  visitors— warmth- 
loving  southern  fishes,  like  the  basking  shark,  the  grotesque  sun- 
fish,  the  six-gilled  shark,  the  swordfish,  and  the  horse  mackerel. 
Some  of  these  same  species  have  penetrated  into  the  Barents 
and  White  seas  and  along  the  Murman  coast. 

As  the  chill  of  the  northern  waters  has  abated  and  the  fish 
have  moved  poleward,  the  fisheries  around  Iceland  have  ex¬ 
panded  enormously,  and  it  has  become  profitable  for  trawlers  to 
push  on  to  Bear  Island,  Spitsbergen,  and  the  Barents  Sea.  These 
waters  now  yield  perhaps  two  billion  pounds  of  cod  a  year— the 
largest  catch  of  a  single  species  by  any  fishery  in  the  world.  But 
its  existence  is  tenuous.  If  the  cycle  turns,  the  waters  begin  to 
chill,  and  the  ice  floes  creep  southward  again,  there  is  nothing 
man  can  do  that  will  preserve  the  arctic  fisheries. 

But  for  the  present,  the  evidence  that  the  top  of  the  world  is 
growing  warmer  is  to  be  found  on  every  hand.  The  recession  of 
the  northern  glaciers  is  going  on  at  such  a  rate  that  many  smaller 
ones  have  already  disappeared.  If  the  present  rate  of  melting 
continues  others  will  soon  follow  them. 

The  melting  away  of  the  snowfields  in  the  Opdal  Mountains 
in  Norway  has  exposed  wooden-shafted  arrows  of  a  type  used 
about  a.d.  400  to  500.  This  suggests  that  the  snow  cover  in  this 
region  must  now  be  less  than  it  has  been  at  any  time  within  the 
past  1400  to  1500  years. 

The  glaciologist  Hans  Ahlmann  reports  that  most  Norwegian 
glaciers  ‘are  living  only  on  their  own  mass  without  receiving  any 
annual  fresh  supply  of  snow’;  that  in  the  Alps  there  has  been  a 
general  retreat  and  shrinkage  of  glaciers  during  the  last  decades, 
which  became  ‘catastrophic’  in  the  summer  of  1947;  anc^  that  a^ 
glaciers  around  the  Northern  Atlantic  coasts  are  shrinking.  The 
most  rapid  recession  of  all  is  occurring  in  Alaska,  where  the  Muir 
Glacier  receded  about  10V2  kilometers  in  12  years.

Man  and  the  Sea  about  Him 


At  present  the  vast  antarctic  glaciers  are  an  enigma;  no  one 
can  say  whether  they  also  are  melting  away,  or  at  what  rate.  But 
reports  from  other  parts  of  the  world  show  that  the  northern 
glaciers  are  not  the  only  ones  that  are  receding.  The  glaciers  of 
several  East  African  high  volcanoes  have  been  diminishing  since 
they  were  first  studied  in  the  1800’s — very  rapidly  since  1920 — 
and  there  is  glacial  shrinkage  in  the  Andes  and  also  in  the  high 
mountains  of  central  Asia. 

The  milder  arctic  and  sub-arctic  climate  seems  already  to  have 
resulted  in  longer  growing  seasons  and  better  crops.  The  cultiva¬ 
tion  of  oats  has  improved  in  Iceland.  In  Norway  good  seed  years 
are  now  the  rule  rather  than  the  exception,  and  even  in  northern 
Scandinavia  the  trees  have  spread  rapidly  above  their  former 
timber  lines,  and  both  pine  and  spruce  are  making  a  quicker 
annual  growth  than  they  have  for  some  time. 

The  countries  where  the  most  striking  changes  are  taking  place 
are  those  whose  climate  is  most  directly  under  the  control  of  the 
North  Atlantic  currents.  Greenland,  Iceland,  Spitsbergen,  and 
all  of  northern  Europe,  as  we  have  seen,  experience  heat  and 
cold,  drought  and  flood  in  accordance  with  the  varying  strength 
and  warmth  of  the  eastward  and  northward-moving  currents  of 
the  Atlantic.  Oceanographers  who  have  been  studying  the  mat¬ 
ter  during  the  1940’s  have  discovered  many  significant  changes 
in  the  temperature  and  distribution  of  great  masses  of  ocean 
water.  Apparently  the  branch  of  the  Gulf  Stream  that  flows  past 
Spitsbergen  has  so  increased  in  volume  that  it  now  brings  in  a 
great  body  of  warm  water.  Surface  waters  of  the  North  Atlantic 
show  rising  temperatures;  so  do  the  deeper  layers  around  Iceland 
and  Spitsbergen.  Sea  temperatures  in  the  North  Sea  and  along 
the  coast  of  Norway  have  been  growing  warmer  since  the  1920’s. 

Unquestionably,  there  are  other  agents  at  work  in  bringing 
about  the  climatic  changes  in  the  Arctic  and  sub-Arctic  regions. 
For  one  thing,  it  is  almost  certainly  true  that  we  are  still  in  the 
warming-up  stage  following  the  last  Pleistocene  glaciation— that 
the  world’s  climate,  over  the  next  thousands  of  years,  will  grow 
considerably  warmer  before  beginning  a  downward  swing  into 
another  Ice  Age.  But  what  we  are  experiencing  now  is  perhaps 


The  Global  Thermostat

a.  climatic  change  of  shorter  duration,  measurable  only  in  dec¬ 
ades  or  centuries.  Some  scientists  say  that  there  must  have  been 
a  small  increase  in  solar  activity,  changing  the  pattern  of  air  cir¬ 
culation  and  causing  the  southerly  winds  to  blow  more  fre¬ 
quently  in  Scandinavia  and  Spitsbergen;  changes  in  ocean  cur¬ 
rents,  according  to  this  view,  are  secondary  effects  of  the  shift 
of  prevailing  winds. 

But  if,  as  Professor  Brooks  thinks,  the  Pettersson  tidal  theory 
has  as  good  a  foundation  as  that  of  changing  solar  radiation, 
then  it  is  interesting  to  calculate  where  our  twentieth-century 
situation  fits  into  the  cosmic  scheme  of  the  shifting  cycles  of  the 
tides.  The  great  tides  at  the  close  of  the  Middle  Ages,  with  their 
accompanying  snow  and  ice,  furious  winds,  and  inundating 
floods,  are  more  than  five  centuries  behind  us.  The  era  of  weak¬ 
est  tidal  movements,  with  a  climate  as  benign  as  that  of  the 
early  Middle  Ages,  is  about  four  centuries  ahead.  We  have  there¬ 
fore  begun  to  move  strongly  into  a  period  of  warmer,  milder 
weather.  There  will  be  fluctuations,  as  earth  and  sun  and  moon 
move  through  space  and  the  tidal  power  waxes  and  wanes.  But 
the  long  trend  is  toward  a  warmer  earth;  the  pendulum  is 
swinging.

A  SEA  CHANGE  INTO  SOMETHING  RICH  AND  STRANGE. 

— Shakespeare 


.  HE  ocean  is  the  earth's  greatest  storehouse  of  minerals.  In 
a  single  cubic  mile  of  sea  water  there  are,  on  the  average,  166 
million  tons  of  dissolved  salts,  and  in  all  the  ocean  waters  of  the 
earth  there  are  about  50  quadrillion  tons.  And  it  is  in  the  nature 
of  things  for  this  quantity  to  be  gradually  increasing  over  the 
millennia,  for  although  the  earth  is  constantly  shifting  her  com¬ 
ponent  materials  from  place  to  place,  the  heaviest  movements 
are  forever  seaward. 

It  has  been  assumed  that  the  first  seas  were  only  faintly  saline 
and  that  their  saltiness  has  been  growing  over  the  eons  of  time. 
For  the  primary  source  of  the  ocean's  salt  is  the  rocky  mantle  of 
the  continents.  When  those  first  rains  came — the  centuries-long 
rains  that  fell  from  the  heavy  clouds  enveloping  the  young  earth 
—they  began  the  processes  of  wearing  away  the  rocks  and  carry¬ 
ing  their  contained  minerals  to  the  sea.  The  annual  flow  of 
water  seaward  is  believed  to  be  about  6500  cubic  miles,  this  in¬ 
flow  of  river  water  adding  to  the  ocean  several  billion  tons  of 
salts. 


Wealth  from  the  Salt  Seas  ^ 

It  is  a  curious  fact  that  there  is  little  similarity  between  the 
chemical  composition  of  river  water  and  that  of  sea  water.  The 
various  elements  are  present  in  entirely  different  proportions. 
The  rivers  bring  in  four  times  as  much  calcium  as  chloride,  for 
example,  yet  in  the  ocean  the  proportions  are  strongly  reversed 

46  times  as  much  chloride  as  calcium.  An  important  reason 
for  the  difference  is  that  immense  amounts  of  calcium  salts  are 
constantly  being  withdrawn  from  the  sea  water  by  marine  ani¬ 
mals  and  are  used  for  building  shells  and  skeletons — for  the 
microscopic  shells  that  house  the  foraminifera,  for  the  massive 
structures  of  the  coral  reefs,  and  for  the  shells  of  oysters  and 
clams  and  other  mollusks.  Another  reason  is  the  precipitation 
of  calcium  from  sea  water.  There  is  a  striking  difference,  too,  in 
the  silicon  content  of  river  and  sea  water— about  500  per  cent 
greater  in  rivers  than  in  the  sea.  The  silica  is  required  by  diatoms 
to  make  their  shells,  and  so  the  immense  quantities  brought  in 
by  rivers  are  largely  utilized  by  these  ubiquitous  plants  of  the 
sea.  Often  there  are  exceptionally  heavy  growths  of  diatoms  off 
the  mouths  of  rivers.  Because  of  the  enormous  total  chemical 
requirements  of  all  the  fauna  and  flora  of  the  sea,  only  a  small 
part  of  the  salts  annually  brought  in  by  rivers  goes  to  increasing 
the  quantity  of  dissolved  minerals  in  the  water.  The  inequalities 
of  chemical  make-up  are  further  reduced  by  reactions  that  are 
set  in  motion  immediately  the  fresh  water  is  discharged  into  the 
sea,  and  by  the  enormous  disparities  of  volume  between  the  in¬ 
coming  fresh  water  and  the  ocean. 

There  are  other  agencies  by  which  minerals  are  added  to  the 
sea— from  obscure  sources  buried  deep  within  the  earth.  From 
every  volcano  chlorine  and  other  gases  escape  into  the  atmos¬ 
phere  and  are  carried  down  in  rain  onto  the  surface  of  land  and 
sea.  Volcanic  ash  and  rock  bring  up  other  materials.  And  all  the 
submarine  volcanoes,  discharging  through  unseen  craters  directly 
into  the  sea,  pour  in  boron,  chlorine,  sulphur,  and  iodine. 

All  this  is  a  one-way  flow  of  minerals  to  the  sea.  Only  to  a 
very  limited  extent  is  there  any  return  of  salts  to  the  land.  We 
attempt  to  recover  some  of  them  directly  by  chemical  extraction 
and  mining,  and  indirectly  by  harvesting  the  sea’s  plants  and 


Man  and  the  Sea  about  Him 


184 

animals.  There  is  another  way,  in  the  long,  recurring  cycles  of 
the  earth,  by  which  the  sea  itself  gives  back  to  the  land  what  it 
has  received.  This  happens  when  the  ocean  waters  rise  over  the 
lands,  deposit  their  sediments,  and  at  last  withdraw,  leaving  over 
the  continent  another  layer  of  sedimentary  rocks.  These  contain 
some  of  the  water  and  salts  of  the  sea.  But  it  is  only  a  temporary 
loan  of  minerals  to  the  land  and  the  return  payment  begins  at 
once  by  way  of  the  old,  familiar  channels— rain,  erosion,  run-off 
to  the  rivers,  transport  to  the  sea. 

There  are  other  curious  little  exchanges  of  materials  between 
sea  and  land.  While  the  process  of  evaporation,  which  raises 
water  vapor  into  the  air,  leaves  most  of  the  salts  behind,  a  sur¬ 
prising  amount  of  salt  does  intrude  itself  into  the  atmosphere 
and  rides  long  distances  on  the  wind.  The  so-called  'cyclic  salt' 
is  picked  up  by  the  winds  from  the  spray  of  a  rough,  cresting  sea 
or  breaking  surf  and  is  blown  inland,  then  brought  down  in  rain 
and  returned  by  rivers  to  the  ocean.  These  tiny,  invisible  par¬ 
ticles  of  sea  salt  drifting  in  the  atmosphere  are,  in  fact,  one  of 
the  many  forms  of  atmospheric  nuclei  around  which  raindrops 
form.  Areas  nearest  the  sea,  in  general,  receive  the  most  salt. 
Published  figures  have  listed  24  to  36  pounds  per  acre  per  year 
for  England  and  more  than  100  pounds  for  British  Guiana.  But 
the  most  astounding  example  of  long-distance,  large-scale  trans¬ 
port  of  cyclic  salts  is  furnished  by  Sambhar  Salt  Lake  in  north¬ 
ern  India.  It  receives  3000  tons  of  salt  a  year,  carried  to  it  on  the 
hot  dry  monsoons  of  summer  from  the  sea,  400  miles  away. 

The  plants  and  animals  of  the  sea  are  very  much  better  chem¬ 
ists  than  men,  and  so  far  our  own  efforts  to  extract  the  mineral 
wealth  of  the  sea  have  been  feeble  compared  with  those  of  lower 
forms  of  life.  They  have  been  able  to  find  and  to  utilize  elements 
present  in  such  minute  traces  that  human  chemists  could  not 
detect  their  presence  until,  very  recently,  highly  refined  methods 
of  spectroscopic  analysis  were  developed. 

We  did  not  know,  for  example,  that  vanadium  occurred  in  the 
sea  until  it  was  discovered  in  the  blood  of  certain  sluggish  and 
sedentary  sea  creatures,  the  holothurians  (of  which  sea  cucum¬ 
bers  are  an  example)  and  the  ascidians.  Relatively  huge  quanti-

ties  of  cobalt  are  extracted  by  lobsters  and  mussels,  and  nickel  is 
utilized  by  various  mollusks,  yet  it  is  only  within  recent  years 
that  we  have  been  able  to  recover  even  traces  of  these  elements. 
Copper  is  recoverable  only  as  about  a  hundredth  part  in  a  mil¬ 
lion  of  sea  water,  yet  it  helps  to  constitute  the  life  blood  of 
lobsters,  entering  into  their  respiratory  pigments  as  iron  does  into 
human  blood. 

In  contrast  to  the  accomplishments  of  invertebrate  chemists, 
we  have  so  far  had  only  limited  success  in  extracting  sea  salts  in 
quantities  we  can  use  for  commercial  purposes,  despite  their 
prodigious  quantity  and  considerable  variety.  We  have  recovered 
about  fifty  of  the  known  elements  by  chemical  analysis,  and 
shall  perhaps  find  that  all  the  others  are  there,  when  we  can 
develop  proper  methods  to  discover  them.  Five  salts  predomi¬ 
nate  and  are  present  in  fixed  proportions.  As  we  would  expect, 
sodium  chloride  is  by  far  the  most  abundant,  making  up  77.8 
per  cent  of  the  total  salts;  magnesium  chloride  follows,  with 
10.9  per  cent;  then  magnesium  sulphate,  4.7  per  cent;  calcium 
sulphate,  3.6  per  cent;  and  potassium  sulphate,  2.5  per  cent.  All 
others  combined  make  up  the  remaining  .5  per  cent. 

Of  all  the  elements  present  in  the  sea,  probably  none  has 
stirred  men's  dreams  more  than  gold.  It  is  there— in  all  the 
waters  covering  the  greater  part  of  the  earth’s  surface— enough 
in  total  quantity  to  make  every  person  in  the  world  a  millionaire. 
But  how  can  the  sea  be  made  to  yield  it?  The  most  determined 
attempt  to  wrest  a  substantial  quantity  of  gold  from  ocean 
waters— and  also  the  most  complete  study  of  the  gold  in  sea 
water — was  made  by  the  German  chemist  Fritz  Haber  after  the 
First  World  War.  Haber  conceived  the  idea  of  extracting 
enough  gold  from  the  sea  to  pay  the  German  war  debt  and  his 
dream  resulted  in  the  German  South  Atlantic  Expedition  of  the 
Meteor.  The  Meteor  was  equipped  with  a  laboratory  and  filtra¬ 
tion  plant,  and  between  the  years  1924  and  1928  the  vessel 
crossed  and  recrossed  the  Atlantic,  sampling  the  water.  But  the 
quantity  found  was  less  than  had  been  expected,  and  the  cost 
of  extraction  far  greater  than  the  value  of  the  gold  recovered. 
The  practical  economics  of  the  matter  are  about  as  follows:  in 


1 86 


Man  and  the  Sea  about  Him 


a  cubic  mile  of  sea  water  there  is  about  $93,000,000  in  gold  and 
$8,500,000  in  silver.  But  to  treat  this  volume  of  water  in  a  year 
would  require  the  twice-daily  filling  and  emptying  of  200  tanks 
of  water,  each  500  feet  square  and  5  feet  deep.  Probably  this  is 
no  greater  feat,  relatively,  than  is  accomplished  regularly  by 
corals,  sponges,  and  oysters,  but  by  human  standards  it  is  not 
economically  feasible. 

Most  mysterious,  perhaps,  of  all  substances  in  the  sea  is  iodine. 
In  sea  water  it  is  one  of  the  scarcest  of  the  nonmetals,  difficult  to 
detect  and  resisting  exact  analysis.  Yet  it  is  found  in  almost  every 
marine  plant  and  animal.  Sponges,  corals,  and  certain  seaweeds 
accumulate  vast  quantities  of  it.  Apparently  the  iodine  in  the  sea 
is  in  a  constant  state  of  chemical  change,  sometimes  being  oxi¬ 
dized.  sometimes  reduced,  again  entering  into  organic  combina¬ 
tions.  There  seem  to  be  constant  interchanges  between  air  and 
sea,  the  iodine  in  some  form  perhaps  being  carried  into  the  air 
in  spray,  for  the  air  at  sea  level  contains  detectable  quantities, 
which  decrease  with  altitude.  From  the  time  living  things  first 
made  iodine  a  part  of  the  chemistry  of  their  tissues,  they  seem 
to  have  become  increasingly  dependent  on  it;  now  we  ourselves 
could  not  exist  without  it  as  a  regulator  of  the  basal  metabolism 
of  our  bodies,  through  the  thyroid  gland  which  accumulates  it. 

All  commercial  iodine  was  formerly  obtained  from  seaweeds; 
then  the  deposits  of  crude  nitrate  of  soda  from  the  high  deserts 
of  North  Chile  were  discovered.  Probably  the  original  source  of 
this  raw  material — called  'caliche’ — was  some  prehistoric  sea 
filled  with  marine  vegetation,  but  that  is  a  subject  of  controversy. 
Iodine  is  obtained  also  from  brine  deposits  and  from  the  subter¬ 
ranean  waters  of  oil-bearing  rocks— all  indirectly  of  marine  ori¬ 
gin. 

A  monopoly  on  the  world’s  bromine  is  held  by  the  ocean, 
where  99  per  cent  of  it  is  now  concentrated.  The  tiny  fraction 
present  in  rocks  was  originally  deposited  there  by  the  sea.  First 
we  obtained  it  from  the  brines  left  in  subterranean  pools  by  pre¬ 
historic  oceans;  now  there  are  large  plants  on  the  seacoasts — 
especially  in  the  United  States — which  use  ocean  water  as  their 
raw  material  and  extract  the  bromine  directlv.  Thanks  to  modern

methods  of  commercial  production  of  bromine  we  have  high-test 
gasoline  for  our  cars.  There  is  a  long  list  of  other  uses,  including 
the  manufacture  of  sedatives,  fire  extinguishers,  photographic 
chemicals,  dyestuffs,  and  chemical  warfare  materials. 

One  of  the  oldest  bromine  derivatives  known  to  man  was 
Tyrian  purple,  which  the  Phoenicians  made  in  their  dyehouses 
from  the  purple  snail,  Murex.  This  snail  may  be  linked  in  a  curi¬ 
ous  and  wonderful  way  with  the  prodigious  and  seemingly  un¬ 
reasonable  quantities  of  bromine  found  today  in  the  Dead  Sea, 
which  contains,  it  is  estimated,  some  850  million  tons  of  the 
chemical.  The  concentration  of  bromine  in  Dead  Sea  water  is 
100  times  that  in  the  ocean.  Apparently  the  supply  is  constantly 
renewed  by  underground  hot  springs,  which  discharge  into  the 
bottom  of  the  Sea  of  Galilee,  which  in  turn  sends  its  waters  to 
the  Dead  Sea  by  way  of  the  River  Jordan.  Some  authorities  be¬ 
lieve  that  the  source  of  the  bromine  in  the  hot  springs  is  a  de¬ 
posit  of  billions  of  ancient  snails,  laid  down  by  the  sea  of  a  by¬ 
gone  age  in  a  stratum  long  since  buried. 

Magnesium  is  another  mineral  we  now  obtain  by  collecting 
huge  volumes  of  ocean  water  and  treating  it  with  chemicals,  al¬ 
though  originally  it  was  derived  only  from  brines  or  from  the 
treatment  of  such  magnesium-containing  rocks  as  dolomite,  of 
which  whole  mountain  ranges  are  composed.  In  a  cubic  mile  of 
sea  water  there  are  about  4  million  tons  of  magnesium.  Since 
the  direct  extraction  method  was  developed  about  1941,  pro¬ 
duction  has  increased  enormously.  It  was  magnesium  from  the 
sea  that  made  possible  the  wartime  growth  of  the  aviation  in¬ 
dustry,  for  every  airplane  made  in  the  United  States  (and  in 
most  other  countries  as  well)  contains  about  half  a  ton  of  mag¬ 
nesium  metal.  And  it  has  innumerable  uses  in  other  industries 
where  a  light-weight  metal  is  desired,  besides  its  long-standing 
utility  as  an  insulating  material,  and  its  use  in  printing  inks, 
medicines,  and  toothpastes,  and  in  such  war  implements  as 
incendiary  bombs,  star  shells,  and  tracer  ammunition. 

Wherever  climate  has  permitted  it,  men  have  evaporated  salt 
from  sea  water  for  many  centuries.  Under  the  burning  sun  of  the 
tropics  the  ancient  Greeks,  Romans,  and  Egyptians  harvested

the  salt  men  and  animals  everywhere  must  have  in  order  to  live. 
Even  today  in  parts  of  the  world  that  are  hot  and  dry  and  where 
drying  winds  blow,  solar  evaporation  of  salt  is  practiced— on  the 
shores  of  the  Persian  Gulf,  in  China,  India,  and  Japan,  in  the 
Philippines,  and  on  the  coast  of  California  and  the  alkali  flats  of 
Utah. 

Here  and  there  are  natural  basins  where  the  action  of  sun  and 
wind  and  sea  combine  to  carry  on  evaporation  of  salt  on  a  scale 
far  greater  than  human  industry  could  accomplish.  Such  a  nat¬ 
ural  basin  is  the  Rann  of  Cutch  on  the  west  coast  of  India.  The 
Rann  is  a  flat  plain,  some  60  by  185  miles,  separated  from  the 
sea  by  the  island  of  Cutch.  When  the  southwest  monsoons  blow, 
sea  water  is  carried  in  by  way  of  a  channel  to  cover  the  plain.  But 
in  summer,  in  the  season  when  the  hot  northeast  monsoon  blows 
from  the  desert,  no  more  water  enters,  and  that  which  is  col¬ 
lected  in  pools  over  the  plain  evaporates  into  a  salt  crust,  in  some 
places  several  feet  thick. 

Where  the  sea  has  come  in  over  the  land,  laid  down  its  de¬ 
posits,  and  then  withdrawn,  there  have  been  created  reservoirs 
of  chemicals,  upon  which  we  can  draw  with  comparatively  little 
trouble.  Hidden  deep  under  the  surface  of  our  earth  are  pools  of 
'fossil  salt  water/  the  brine  of  ancient  seas;  'fossil  deserts/  the 
salt  of  old  seas  that  evaporated  away  under  conditions  of  ex¬ 
treme  heat  and  dryness;  and  layers  of  sedimentary  rock  in  which 
are  contained  the  organic  sediments  and  the  dissolved  salts  of 
the  sea  that  deposited  them. 

During  the  Permian  period,  which  was  a  time  of  great  heat 
and  dryness  and  widespread  deserts,  a  vast  inland  sea  formed 
over  much  of  Europe,  covering  parts  of  the  present  Britain, 
France,  Germany,  and  Poland.  Rains  came  seldom  and  the  rate 
of  evaporation  was  high.  The  sea  became  exceedingly  salty,  and 
it  began  to  deposit  layers  of  salts.  For  a  period  covering  thou¬ 
sands  of  years,  only  gypsum  was  deposited,  perhaps  representing 
a  time  when  water  fresh  from  the  ocean  occasionally  entered  the 
inland  sea  to  mix  with  its  strong  brine.  Alternating  with  the  gyp¬ 
sum  were  thicker  beds  of  salt.  Later,  as  its  area  shrank  and  the 
sea  grew  still  more  concentrated,  deposits  of  potassium  and  mag-

nesium  sulphates  were  formed  (this  stage  representing  perhaps 
500  years);  still  later,  and  perhaps  for  another  500  years,  there 
were  laid  down  mixed  potassium  and  magnesium  chlorides  or 
carnallite.  After  the  sea  had  completely  evaporated,  desert  con¬ 
ditions  prevailed,  and  soon  the  salt  deposits  were  buried  under 
sand.  The  richest  beds  form  the  famous  deposits  of  Stassfurt  and 
Alsace;  toward  the  outskirts  of  the  original  area  of  the  old  sea 
(as,  for  example,  in  England)  there  are  only  beds  of  salt.  The 
Stassfurt  beds  are  about  2500  feet  thick;  their  springs  of  brine 
have  been  known  since  the  thirteenth  century,  and  the  salts  have 
been  mined  since  the  seventeenth  century. 

At  an  even  earlier  geological  period— the  Silurian— a  great  salt 
basin  was  deposited  in  the  northern  part  of  the  United  States, 
extending  from  central  New  York  State  across  Michigan,  includ¬ 
ing  northern  Pennsylvania  and  Ohio  and  part  of  southern  On¬ 
tario.  Because  of  the  hot,  dry  climate  of  that  time,  the  inland  sea 
lying  over  this  place  grew  so  salty  that  beds  of  salt  and  gypsum 
were  deposited  over  a  great  area  covering  about  100,000  square 
miles.  There  are  seven  distinct  beds  of  salt  at  Ithaca,  New  York, 
the  uppermost  lying  at  a  depth  of  about  half  a  mile.  In  southern 
Michigan  some  of  the  individual  salt  beds  are  more  than  500 
feet  thick,  and  the  aggregate  thickness  of  salt  in  the  center  of 
the  Michigan  Basin  is  approximately  2000  feet.  In  some  places 
rock  salt  is  mined;  in  others  wells  are  dug,  water  is  forced  down, 
and  the  resulting  brine  is  pumped  to  the  surface  and  evaporated 
to  recover  the  salt. 

One  of  the  greatest  stock  piles  of  minerals  in  the  world  came 
from  the  evaporation  of  a  great  inland  sea  in  the  western  United 
States.  This  is  Searles  Lake  in  the  Mohave  Desert  of  California. 
An  arm  of  the  sea  that  overlay  this  region  was  cut  off  from  the 
ocean  by  the  thrusting  up  of  a  range  of  mountains;  as  the  lake 
evaporated  away,  the  water  that  remained  became  ever  more 
salty  through  the  inwash  of  minerals  from  all  the  surrounding 
land.  Perhaps  Searles  Lake  began  its  slow  transformation  from  a 
landlocked  sea  to  a  'frozen’  lake — a  lake  of  solid  minerals — only 
a  few  thousand  years  ago;  now  its  surface  is  a  hard  crust  of  salts 
over  which  a  car  may  be  driven.  The  crystals  of  salts  form  a  layer 


190 


Man  and  the  Sea  about  Him 

50  to  70  feet  deep.  Below  that  is  mud.  Engineers  have  recently 
discovered  a  second  layer  of  salts  and  brine,  probably  at  least  as 
thick  as  the  upper  layer,  underlying  the  mud.  Searles  Lake  was 
first  worked  in  the  1870  s  for  borax;  then  teams  of  20  mules  each 
carried  the  borax  across  desert  and  mountains  to  the  railroads. 
In  the  1930's  the  recovery  of  other  substances  from  the  lake 
began— bromine,  lithium,  and  salts  of  potassium  and  sodium. 
Now  Searles  Lake  yields  40  per  cent  of  the  production  of  potas¬ 
sium  chloride  in  the  United  States  and  a  large  share  of  all  the 
borax  and  lithium  salts  produced  in  the  world. 

In  some  future  era  the  Dead  Sea  will  probably  repeat  the  his¬ 
tory7  of  Searles  Lake,  as  the  centuries  pass  and  evaporation  con¬ 
tinues.  The  Dead  Sea  as  we  know  it  is  all  that  remains  of  a  much 
larger  inland  sea  that  once  filled  the  entire  Jordan  Valley  and 
was  about  190  miles  long;  now  it  has  shrunk  to  about  a  fourth  of 
this  length  and  a  fourth  of  its  former  volume.  And  with  the 
shrinkage  and  the  evaporation  in  the  hot  dry  climate  has  come 
the  concentration  of  salts  that  makes  the  Dead  Sea  a  great 
reservoir  of  minerals.  No  animal  life  can  exist  in  its  brine;  such 
luckless  fish  as  are  brought  down  by  the  River  Jordan  die  and 
provide  food  for  the  sea  birds.  It  is  1300  feet  below  the  Mediter¬ 
ranean,  lying  farther  below  sea  level  than  any  other  body  of 
water  in  the  world.  It  occupies  the  lowest  part  of  the  rift  valley 
of  the  Jordan,  which  was  created  by  a  down-slipping  of  a  block 
•of  the  earth  s  crust.  The  water  of  the  Dead  Sea  is  warmer  than 
the  air,  a  condition  favoring  evaporation,  and  clouds  of  its  vapor 
float,  nebulous  and  half  formed,  above  it,  while  its  brine  grows 
more  bitter  and  the  salts  accumulate. 

Of  all  legacies  of  the  ancient  seas  the  most  valuable  is  petro¬ 
leum.  Exactly  what  geologic  processes  have  created  the  precious 
pools  of  liquid  deep  within  the  earth  no  one  knows  with  enough 
certainty  to  describe  the  whole  sequence  of  events.  But  this 
much  seems  to  be  true:  Petroleum  is  a  result  of  fundamental 
earth  processes  that  have  been  operating  ever  since  an  abundant 
and  varied  life  was  developed  in  the  sea— at  least  since  the  be¬ 
ginning  of  Paleozoic  time,  probably  longer.  Exceptional  and 
catastrophic  occurrences  may  now  and  then  aid  its  formation

but  they  are  not  essential;  the  mechanism  that  regularly  gener¬ 
ates  petroleum  consists  of  the  normal  processes  of  earth  and  sea 

the  living  and  dying  of  creatures,  the  deposit  of  sediments,  the 
advance  and  retreat  of  the  seas  over  the  continents,  the  upward 
and  downward  foldings  of  the  earth's  crust. 

The  old  inorganic  theory  that  linked  petroleum  formation 
with  volcanic  action  has  been  abandoned  by  most  geologists. 
The  origin  of  petroleum  is  most  likely  to  be  found  in  the  bodies 
of  plants  and  animals  buried  under  the  fine-grained  sediments 
of  former  seas  and  there  subjected  to  slow  decomposition. 

Perhaps  the  essence  of  conditions  favoring  petroleum  produc¬ 
tion  is  represented  by  the  stagnant  waters  of  the  Black  Sea  or  of 
certain  Norwegian  fiords.  The  surprisingly  abundant  life  of  the 
Black  Sea  is  confined  to  the  upper  layers;  the  deeper  and  espe¬ 
cially  the  bottom  waters  are  devoid  of  oxygen  and  are  often  per¬ 
meated  with  hydrogen  sulphide.  In  these  poisoned  waters  there 
can  be  no  bottom  scavengers  to  devour  the  bodies  of  marine 
animals  that  drift  down  from  above,  so  they  are  entombed  in  the 
fine  sediments.  In  many  Norwegian  fiords  the  deep  layers  are 
foul  and  oxygenless  because  the  mouth  of  the  fiord  is  cut  off 
from  the  circulation  of  the  open  sea  by  a  shallow  sill.  The  bot¬ 
tom  layers  of  such  fiords  are  poisoned  by  the  hydrogen  sulphide 
from  decomposing  organic  matter.  Sometimes  storms  drive  in 
unusual  quantities  of  oceanic  water  and  through  turbulence  of 
waves  stir  deeply  the  waters  of  these  lethal  pools;  the  mixing  of 
the  water  layers  that  follows  brings  death  to  hordes  of  fishes 
and  invertebrates  living  near  the  surface.  Such  a  catastrophe 
leads  to  the  deposit  of  a  rich  layer  of  organic  material  on  the 
bottom. 

Wherever  great  oil  fields  are  found,  they  are  related  to  past 
or  present  seas.  This  is  true  of  the  inland  fields  as  well  as  of 
those  near  the  present  seacoast.  The  great  quantities  of  oil  that 
have  been  obtained  from  the  Oklahoma  fields,  for  example, 
were  trapped  in  spaces  within  sedimentary  rocks  laid  down 
under  seas  that  invaded  this  part  of  North  America  in  Paleozoic 
time. 

The  search  for  petroleum  has  also  led  geologists  repeatedly  to 


192 


Man  and  the  Sea  about  Him 


those  'unstable  belts,  covered  much  of  the  time  by  shallow  seas, 
which  lie  around  the  margins  of  the  main  continental  platforms, 
between  them  and  the  great  oceanic  deeps/ 

An  example  of  such  a  depressed  segment  of  crust  lying  be¬ 
tween  continental  masses  is  the  one  between  Europe  and  the 
Near  East,  occupied  in  part  by  the  Persian  Gulf,  the  Red,  Black, 
and  Caspian  seas,  and  the  Mediterranean  Sea.  The  Gulf  of 
Mexico  and  the  Caribbean  Sea  lie  in  another  basin  or  shallow 
sea  between  the  Americas.  A  shallow,  island-studded  sea  lies 
between  the  continents  of  Asia  and  Australia.  Lastly,  there  is 
the  nearly  landlocked  sea  of  the  Arctic.  In  past  ages  all  of  these 
areas  have  been  alternately  raised  and  depressed,  belonging  at 
one  time  to  the  land,  at  another  to  the  encroaching  sea.  During 
their  periods  of  submersion  they  have  received  thick  deposits 
of  sediments,  and  in  their  waters  a  rich  marine  fauna  has  lived, 
died,  and  drifted  down  into  the  soft  sediment  carpet. 

There  are  vast  oil  deposits  in  all  these  areas.  In  the  Near  East 
are  the  great  fields  of  Saudi  Arabia,  Iran,  and  Iraq.  The  shallow 
depression  between  Asia  and  Australia  yields  the  oil  of  Java, 
Sumatra,  Borneo,  and  New  Guinea.  The  American  mediterra¬ 
nean  is  the  center  of  oil  production  in  the  Western  Hemisphere 
—half  the  proved  resources  of  the  United  States  come  from  the 
northern  shore  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  and  Colombia,  Vene¬ 
zuela,  and  Mexico  have  rich  oil  fields  along  the  western  and 
southern  margins  of  the  Gulf.  The  Arctic  is  one  of  the  unproved 
frontiers  of  the  petroleum  industry,  but  oil  seepages  in  northern 
Alaska,  on  islands  north  of  the  Canadian  mainland,  and  along 
the  Arctic  coast  of  Siberia  hint  that  this  land  recently  raised 
from  the  sea  may  be  one  of  the  great  oil  fields  of  the  future. 

In  recent  years,  the  speculations  of  petroleum  geologists  have 
been  focused  in  a  new  direction— under  sea.  By  no  means  all  of 
the  land  resources  of  petroleum  have  been  discovered,  but  prob¬ 
ably  the  richest  and  most  easily  worked  fields  are  being  tapped, 
and  their  possible  production  is  known.  The  ancient  seas  gave  us 
the  oil  that  is  now  being  drawn  out  of  the  earth.  Can  the  ocean 
today  be  induced  to  give  up  some  of  the  oil  that  must  be  trapped

in  sedimentary  rocks  under  its  floor,  covered  by  water  scores  or 
hundreds  of  fathoms  deep? 

Oil  is  already  being  produced  from  offshore  wells,  on  the  con¬ 
tinental  shelf.  Off  California,  Texas,  and  Louisiana,  oil  com¬ 
panies  have  drilled  into  the  sediments  of  the  shelf  and  are  ob¬ 
taining  oil.  In  the  United  States  the  most  active  exploration  has 
been  centered  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico.  Judging  from  its  geologic 
history,  this  area  has  rich  promise.  For  eons  of  time  it  was  either 
dry  land  or  a  very  shallow  sea  basin,  receiving  the  sediments  that 
washed  into  it  from  high  lands  to  the  north.  Finally,  about  the 
middle  of  the  Cretaceous  period,  the  floor  of  the  Gulf  began  to 
sink  under  the  load  of  sediments  and  in  time  it  acquired  its 
present  deep  central  basin. 

By  geophysical  exploration,  we  can  see  that  the  layers  of  sedi¬ 
mentary  rock  underlying  the  coastal  plain  tilt  steeply  downward 
and  pass  under  the  broad  continental  shelf  of  the  Gulf.  Down  in 
the  layers  deposited  in  the  Jurassic  period  is  a  thick  salt  bed  of 
enormous  extent,  probably  formed  when  this  part  of  the  earth 
was  hot  and  dry,  a  place  of  shrinking  seas  and  encroaching  des¬ 
erts.  In  Louisiana  and  Texas,  and  also,  it  now  appears,  out  in 
the  Gulf  itself,  extraordinary  features  known  as  salt  domes  are 
associated  with  this  deposit.  These  are  fingerlike  plugs  of  salt, 
usually  less  than  a  mile  across,  pushing  up  from  the  deep  layer 
toward  the  earth’s  surface.  They  have  been  described  by  geolo¬ 
gists  as  'driven  up  through  5000  to  15,000  feet  of  sediments  by 
earth  pressures,  like  nails  through  a  board.’  In  the  states  border¬ 
ing  the  Gulf  such  structures  have  often  been  associated  with  oil. 
It  seems  probable  that  on  the  continental  shelf,  also,  the  salt 
domes  may  mark  large  oil  deposits. 

In  exploring  the  Gulf  for  oil,  therefore,  geologists  search  for 
the  salt  domes  where  the  larger  oil  fields  are  likely  to  lie.  They 
use  an  instrument  known  as  a  magnetometer,  which  measures 
the  variations  in  magnetic  intensity  brought  about  by  the  salt 
domes.  Gravity  meters  also  help  locate  the  domes  by  measuring 
the  variation  in  gravity  near  them,  the  specific  gravity  of  salt 
being  less  than  that  of  the  surrounding  sediments.  The  actual 


194 


Man  and  the  Sea  about  Him 


location  and  outline  of  the  dome  are  discovered  by  seismo- 
graphic  exploration,  which  traces  the  inclination  of  the  rock 
strata  by  recording  the  reflection  of  sound  waves  produced  by 
dynamite  explosions.  These  methods  of  exploration  have  been 
used  on  land  for  some  years,  but  only  since  about  1945  have  they 
been  adapted  to  use  in  offshore  Gulf  waters.  The  magnetometer 
has  been  so  improved  that  it  will  map  continuously  while  being 
towed  behind  a  boat  or  carried  in  or  suspended  from  a  plane. 
A  gravity  meter  can  now  be  lowered  rapidly  to  the  bottom  and 
readings  made  by  remote  control.  (Once  an  operator  had  to 
descend  with  it  in  a  diving  bell.)  Seismic  crews  may  shoot  off 
their  dynamite  charges  and  make  continuous  recordings  while 
their  boats  are  under  way. 

Despite  all  these  improvements  which  allow  exploration  to 
proceed  rapidly,  it  is  no  simple  matter  to  obtain  oil  from  under¬ 
sea  fields.  Prospecting  must  be  followed  by  the  leasing  of  poten¬ 
tial  oil-producing  areas,  and  then  by  drilling  to  see  whether  oil 
is  actually  there.  Offshore  drilling  platforms  rest  on  piles  that 
must  be  driven  as  far  as  250  feet  into  the  floor  of  the  Gulf  to 
withstand  the  force  of  waves,  especially  during  the  season  for 
hurricanes.  Winds,  storm  waves,  fogs,  the  corrosive  gnawing  of 
sea  water  upon  metal  structures— all  these  are  hazards  that  must 
be  faced  and  overcome.  Yet  the  technical  difficulties  of  far  more 
extensive  offshore  operations  than  any  now  attempted  do  not  dis¬ 
courage  specialists  in  petroleum  engineering. 

So  our  search  for  mineral  wealth  often  leads  us  back  to  the 
seas  of  ancient  times— to  the  oil  pressed  from  the  bodies  of  fishes, 
seaweeds,  and  other  forms  of  plant  and  animal  life  and  then 
stored  away  in  ancient  rocks;  to  the  rich  brines  hidden  in  subter¬ 
ranean  pools  where  the  fossil  water  of  old  seas  still  remains;  to 
the  layers  of  salts  that  are  the  mineral  substance  of  those  old  seas 
laid  down  as  a  covering  mantle  over  the  continents.  Perhaps  in 
time,  as  we  learn  the  chemical  secrets  of  the  corals  and  sponges 
and  diatoms,  we  shall  depend  less  on  the  stored  wealth  of  pre¬ 
historic  seas  and  shall  go  more  and  more  directly  to  the  ocean 
and  the  rocks  now  forming  under  its  shallow  waters. 


The  Encircling  Sea 


A  SEA  FROM  WHICH  BIRDS  TRAVEL  NOT  WITHIN  A  YEAR, 

SO  VAST  IT  IS  AND  FEARFUL. 

— Homer 


I  O  the  ancient  Greeks  the  ocean  was  an  endless  stream  that 
flowed  forever  around  the  border  of  the  world,  ceaselessly  turn¬ 
ing  upon  itself  like  a  wheel,  the  end  of  earth,  the  beginning  of 
heaven.  This  ocean  was  boundless;  it  was  infinite.  If  a  person 
were  to  venture  far  out  upon  it— were  such  a  course  thinkable— 
he  would  pass  through  gathering  darkness  and  obscuring  fog 
and  would  come  at  last  to  a  dreadful  and  chaotic  blending  of 
sea  and  sky,  a  place  where  whirlpools  and  yawning  abysses 
waited  to  draw  the  traveler  down  into  a  dark  world  from  which 
there  was  no  return. 

These  ideas  are  found,  in  varying  form,  in  much  of  the  litera¬ 
ture  of  the  ten  centuries  before  the  Christian  era,  and  in  later 
years  they  keep  recurring  even  through  the  greater  part  of  the 
Middle  Ages.  To  the  Greeks  the  familiar  Mediterranean  was 
The  Sea.  Outside,  bathing  the  periphery  of  the  land  world,  was 
Oceanus.  Perhaps  somewhere  in  its  uttermost  expanse  was  the 
home  of  the  gods  and  of  departed  spirits,  the  Elysian  fields.  So 
we  meet  the  ideas  of  unattainable  continents  or  of  beautiful

islands  in  the  distant  ocean,  confusedly  mingled  with  references 
to  a  bottomless  gulf  at  the  edge  of  the  world — but  always  around 
the  disc  of  the  habitable  world  was  the  vast  ocean,  encircling  all. 

Perhaps  some  word-of-mouth  tales  of  the  mysterious  northern 
world,  filtering  down  by  way  of  the  early  trade  routes  for  amber 
and  tin,  colored  the  conceptions  of  the  early  legends,  so  that  the 
boundary  of  the  land  world  came  to  be  pictured  as  a  place  of  fog 
and  storms  and  darkness.  Homer’s  Odyssey  described  the  Cim¬ 
merians  as  dwelling  in  a  distant  realm  of  mist  and  darkness  on 
the  shores  of  Oceanus,  and  they  told  of  the  shepherds  who  lived 
in  the  land  of  the  long  day,  where  the  paths  of  day  and  night 
were  close.  And  again  perhaps  the  early  poets  and  historians  de¬ 
rived  some  of  their  ideas  of  the  ocean  from  the  Phoenicians, 
whose  craft  roamed  the  shores  of  Europe,  Asia,  and  Africa  in 
search  of  gold,  silver,  gems,  spices,  and  wood  for  their  commerce 
with  kings  and  emperors.  It  may  well  be  that  these  sailor-mer¬ 
chants  were  the  first  ever  to  cross  an  ocean,  but  history  does  not 
record  the  fact.  For  at  least  2000  years  before  Christ— probably 
longer— the  flourishing  trade  of  the  Phoenicians  was  plied  along 
the  shores  of  the  Red  Sea  to  Syria,  to  Somaliland,  to  Arabia, 
even  to  India  and  perhaps  to  China.  Herodotus  wrote  that  they 
circumnavigated  Africa  from  east  to  west  about  600  b.c.,  reach¬ 
ing  Egypt  via  the  Straits  of  the  Pillars  and  the  Mediterranean. 
But  the  Phoenicians  themselves  said  and  wrote  little  or  nothing 
of  their  voyagings,  keeping  their  trade  routes  and  the  sources  of 
their  precious  cargoes  secret.  So  there  are  only  the  vaguest 
rumors,  sketchily  supported  by  archaeological  findings,  that  the 
Phoenicians  may  have  launched  out  into  the  open  Pacific. 

Nor  are  there  anything  but  rumors  and  highly  plausible  sup¬ 
positions  that  the  Phoenicians,  on  their  coastwise  journeys  along 
western  Europe,  may  have  sailed  as  far  north  as  the  Scandina¬ 
vian  peninsula  and  the  Baltic,  source  of  the  precious  amber. 
There  are  no  definite  traces  of  any  such  visits  by  them,  and  of 
course  the  Phoenicians  have  left  no  written  record  of  any.  Of  one 
of  their  European  voyages,  however,  there  is  a  secondhand  ac¬ 
count.  This  was  the  expedition  under  Himlico  of  Carthage, 
which  sailed  northward  along  the  European  coast  about  the  year 


The  Encircling  Sea 


i97 

500  b.c.  Himlico  apparently  wrote  an  account  of  this  voyage,  al¬ 
though  his  manuscript  was  not  preserved.  But  his  descriptions 
are  quoted  by  the  Roman  Avienus,  writing  nearly  a  thousand 
years  later.  According  to  Avienus,  Himlico  painted  a  discourag¬ 
ing  picture  of  the  coastwise  seas  of  Europe: 

These  seas  can  scarcely  be  sailed  through  in  four  months . .  . 
no  breeze  drives  the  ship  forward,  so  dead  is  the  sluggish  wind 
of  this  idle  sea  .  .  .  There  is  much  seaweed  among  the  waves  . . . 
the  surface  of  the  earth  is  barely  covered  by  a  little  water  . .  .  The 
monsters  of  the  sea  move  continually  hither  and  thither,  and 
the  wild  beasts  swim  among  the  sluggish  and  slowly  creeping 
ships. 

Perhaps  the  wild  beasts’  are  the  whales  of  the  Bay  of  Biscay, 
later  to  become  a  famous  whaling  ground;  the  shallow  water 
areas  that  so  impressed  Himlico  may  have  been  the  flats  alter¬ 
nately  exposed  and  covered  by  the  ebb  and  flow  of  the  great 
tides  of  the  French  coast— a  strange  phenomenon  to  one  from 
the  almost  tideless  Mediterranean.  But  Himlico  also  had  ideas 
of  the  open  ocean  to  the  west,  if  the  account  of  Avienus  is  to  be 
trusted:  ‘Farther  to  the  west  from  these  Pillars  there  is  boundless 
sea  . . .  None  has  sailed  ships  over  these  waters,  because  propel¬ 
ling  winds  are  lacking  on  these  deeps . . .  likewise  because  dark¬ 
ness  screens  the  light  of  day  with  a  sort  of  clothing,  and  because 
a  fog  always  conceals  the  sea.’  Whether  these  descriptive  details 
are  touches  of  Phoenician  canniness  or  merely  the  old  ideas  re¬ 
asserting  themselves  it  is  hard  to  say,  but  much  the  same  concep¬ 
tions  appear  again  and  again  in  later  accounts,  echoing  down  the 
centuries  to  the  very  threshold  of  modern  times. 

So  far  as  historical  records  are  concerned,  the  first  great  voy¬ 
age  of  marine  exploration  was  by  Pytheas  of  Massilia  about  330 
b.c.  Unfortunately  his  writings,  including  one  called  On  the 
Ocean ,  are  lost  and  their  substance  is  preserved  for  us  only  in 
fragmentary  quotations  passed  on  by  later  writers.  We  know 
very  little  of  the  controlling  circumstances  of  the  northward 
voyage  of  this  astronomer  and  geographer,  but  probably  Pytheas 
wished  to  see  how  far  the  oecumene  or  land  world  extended,  to

learn  the  position  of  the  Arctic  Circle,  and  to  see  the  land  of 
midnight  sun.  Some  of  these  things  he  may  have  heard  of 
through  the  merchants  who  brought  down  tin  and  amber  from 
the  Baltic  lands  by  the  overland  trade  routes. 

Since  Pytheas  was  the  first  to  use  astronomical  measurements 
to  determine  the  geographic  location  of  a  place  and  in  other 
ways  had  proved  his  competence  as  an  astronomer,  he  brought 
more  than  ordinary  skill  to  an  exploratory  voyage.  He  seems  to 
have  sailed  around  Great  Britain,  to  have  reached  the  Shetland 
Islands,  and  then  to  have  launched  out  into  the  open  ocean  to 
the  north,  coming  at  last  to  'Thule/  the  land  of  midnight  sun. 
In  this  country,  he  is  quoted  as  reporting,  'the  nights  were  very 
short,  in  some  places  two,  in  others  three  hours  long,  so  that  the 
sun  rose  again  a  short  time  after  it  had  set/  The  country  was  in¬ 
habited  by  'barbarians’  who  showed  Pytheas  'the  place  where 
the  sun  goes  to  rest/  The  location  of  ‘Thule’  is  a  point  much 
disputed  by  later  authorities,  some  believing  it  to  have  been 
Iceland,  while  others  believe  that  Pytheas  crossed  the  North  Sea 
to  Norway.  Pytheas  is  also  said  to  have  described  a  ‘congealed 
sea’  lying  north  of  Thule,  which  accords  better  with  Iceland. 

But  the  Dark  Ages  were  settling  down  over  the  civilized  world, 
and  little  of  the  knowledge  of  distant  places  acquired  by  Pytheas 
on  his  voyagings  seems  to  have  impressed  the  learned  men  who 
followed  him.  The  geographer  Posidonius  wrote  of  the  ocean 
that  ‘stretched  to  infinity’  and  from  Rhodes  he  undertook  a  jour¬ 
ney  all  the  way  to  Gadir  (Cadiz)  to  see  the  ocean,  measure  its 
tides,  and  determine  the  truth  of  the  belief  that  the  sun  dropped 
with  the  hissing  of  a  red-hot  body  into  the  great  western  sea. 

Not  for  about  1200  years  after  Pytheas  do  we  have  another 
clear  account  of  marine  exploration— this  time  by  the  Norwegian 
Ottar.  Ottar  described  his  voyagings  in  northern  seas  to  King 
Alfred,  who  recorded  them  in  a  straightforward  narrative  of  geo¬ 
graphic  exploration  strikingly  free  from  sea  monsters  and  other 
imaginary  terrors.  Ottar,  on  the  basis  of  this  account,  was  the 
first  known  explorer  to  round  the  North  Cape,  to  enter  the  Polar 
or  Barents  Sea,  and  later  to  enter  the  White  Sea.  He  found  the 
coasts  of  these  seas  inhabited  by  people  of  whom  he  seems  to

have  heard  previously.  According  to  the  narrative,  he  went  there 
‘chiefly  to  explore  the  country,  and  for  the  sake  of  the  walrus, 
for  they  have  much  valuable  bone  in  their  tusks/  This  voyage 
was  probably  made  between  a.d.  870  and  890. 

Meanwhile  the  age  of  the  Vikings  had  dawned.  The  beginning 
of  their  more  important  expeditions  is  usually  considered  to  be 
the  end  of  the  eighth  century.  But  long  before  that  time  they 
had  visited  other  countries  of  northern  Europe.  ‘As  early  as  the 
third  century  and  until  the  close  of  the  fifth  century/  wrote 
Fridtjof  Nansen,  the  roving  Eruli  sailed  from  Scandinavia,  some¬ 
times  in  company  with  Saxon  pirates,  over  the  seas  of  western 
Europe,  ravaging  the  coasts  of  Gaul  and  Spain,  and  indeed  pene¬ 
trating  in  455  into  the  Mediterranean  as  far  as  Lucca  in  Italy/ 
As  early  as  the  sixth  century  the  Vikings  must  have  crossed  the 
North  Sea  to  the  land  of  the  Franks,  and  probably  to  southern 
Britain.  They  may  have  established  themselves  in  Shetland  by 
the  beginning  of  the  seventh  century,  and  plundered  the  Heb¬ 
rides  and  northwest  Ireland  about  the  same  time.  Later  they 
sailed  to  the  Faroes  and  to  Iceland;  in  the  last  quarter  of  the 
tenth  century  they  established  two  colonies  in  Greenland,  and 
shortly  thereafter  they  steered  across  the  intervening  Atlantic 
waters  to  North  America.  Of  the  place  of  these  voyages  in  his¬ 
tory  Nansen  writes: 

The  shipbuilding  and  seamanship  of  the  Norwegians  mark  a 
new  epoch  in  the  history  both  of  navigation  and  discovery,  and 
with  their  voyages  the  knowledge  of  northern  lands  and  waters 
was  at  once  completely  changed  . .  .  We  find  accounts  of  these 
voyages  of  discovery  in  the  old  writings  and  sagas,  a  large  part 
of  which  was  put  into  writing  in  Iceland.  A  somber  undercurrent 
runs  through  these  narratives  of  voyages  in  unknown  seas — the 
silent  struggle  of  hardy  men  with  ice,  storms,  cold,  and  want. 

They  had  neither  compass,  nor  astronomical  instruments,  nor 
any  of  the  appliances  of  our  time  for  finding  their  position  at  sea; 
they  could  only  sail  by  the  sun,  moon,  and  stars,  and  it  seems 
incomprehensible  how  for  days  and  weeks,  when  these  were  in¬ 
visible,  they  were  able  to  find  their  course  through  fog  and  bad 
weather;  but  they  found  it,  and  in  the  open  craft  of  the  Nor¬ 
wegian  Vikings,  with  their  square  sails,  fared  north  and  west

over  the  whole  ocean,  from  Novaya  Zemlya  and  Spitsbergen  to 
Greenland,  Baffin  Bay,  Newfoundland,  and  North  America.  . . . 
It  was  not  until  five  hundred  years  later  that  the  ships  of  other 
nations  were  to  make  their  way  to  the  same  regions.* 

But  only  the  vaguest  rumors  of  any  of  these  things  had 
reached  the  ‘civilized  world’  of  the  Mediterranean.  While  the 
sagas  of  the  Norsemen  were  giving  clear  and  factual  directions 
for  the  passage  across  oceans,  from  known  to  unknown  worlds, 
the  writings  of  the  scholars  of  the  medieval  world  dealt  still  with 
that  outermost  encircling  ocean,  the  dread  Sea  of  Darkness. 
About  the  year  1154  the  noted  Arab  geographer  Edrisi  wrote  for 
the  Norman  king  of  Sicily,  Roger  II,  a  description  of  the  earth, 
accompanied  by  70  maps,  which  portrayed  on  the  outside  of  all 
the  known  earth  the  Dark  Sea,  forming  the  limit  of  the  world. 
He  wrote  of  the  sea  about  the  British  Isles  that  it  is  ‘impossible 
to  penetrate  very  far  into  this  ocean.’  He  hinted  at  the  existence 
of  far  islands  but  thought  the  approach  to  them  difficult  because 
of  the  ‘fog  and  deep  darkness  that  prevails  on  this  sea.’  The 
scholarly  Adam  of  Bremen,  writing  in  the  eleventh  century, 
knew  of  the  existence  of  Greenland  and  Wineland  as  distant 
islands  in  the  great  ocean,  but  could  not  separate  the  reality 
from  the  old  ideas  of  that  sea,  ‘infinite  and  fearful  to  behold, 
which  encompasses  the  whole  world,’  that  ocean  flowing  ‘end¬ 
lessly  around  the  circle  of  the  earth.’  And  even  the  Norsemen 
themselves,  as  they  discovered  lands  across  the  Atlantic,  seem 
merely  to  have  pushed  back  the  boundaries  of  the  place  where 
still  there  began  that  outermost  ocean,  for  the  idea  of  the  outer 
ocean  surrounding  the  disc  of  the  earth  appears  in  such  North¬ 
ern  chronicles  as  the  Kings  Mirror  and  the  Heimskringla.  And  so 
over  that  Western  Ocean  into  which  Columbus  and  his  men 
set  out  there  hung  still  the  legend  of  a  dead  and  stagnant  sea, 
of  monsters  and  entrapping  weeds,  of  fog  and  gloom  and  ever 
present  danger. 

Yet  centuries  before  Columbus— no  one  knows  how  many  cen-

tunes— men  on  the  opposite  side  of  the  world  had  laid  aside 
whatever  fears  the  ocean  may  have  inspired  and  were  boldly 
sailing  their  craft  across  the  Pacific.  We  know  little  of  the  hard¬ 
ships,  the  difficulties,  and  the  fears  that  may  have  beset  the 
Polynesian  colonists— we  know  only  that  somehow  they  came 
from  the  mainland  to  those  islands,  remote  from  any  shore. 
Perhaps  the  aspect  of  these  central  Pacific  waters  was  kindlier 
than  that  of  the  North  Atlantic— it  must  have  been— for  in  their 
open  canoes  they  entrusted  themselves  to  the  stars  and  the  sign¬ 
posts  of  the  sea  and  found  their  way  from  island  to  island. 

We  do  not  know  when  the  first  Polynesian  voyages  took  place. 
Concerning  the  later  ones,  there  is  some  evidence  that  the  last 
important  colonizing  voyage  to  the  Hawaiian  Islands  was  made 
m  the  thirteenth  century,  and  that  about  the  middle  of  the  four¬ 
teenth  century  a  fleet  from  Tahiti  permanently  colonized  New 
Zealand.  But  again,  all  these  things  were  unknown  in  Europe, 
and  long  after  the  Polynesians  had  mastered  the  art  of  navigat¬ 
ing  unknown  seas,  the  European  sailors  still  regarded  the  Pillars 
of  Hercules  as  the  gateway  to  a  dreaded  sea  of  darkness. 

Once  Columbus  had  shown  the  way  to  the  West  Indies  and 
the  Americas,  once  Balboa  had  seen  the  Pacific  and  Magellan 
had  sailed  around  the  globe,  there  arose,  and  long  persisted,  two 
new  ideas.  One  concerned  the  existence  of  a  northern  passage 
by  sea  to  Asia;  the  other  had  to  do  with  a  great  southern  conti¬ 
nent  generally  believed  to  lie  below  the  then-known  lands. 

Magellan,  while  sailing  through  the  strait  that  now  bears  his 
name,  had  seen  land  to  the  south  of  him  through  all  the  thirty- 
seven  days  required  for  the  passage  through  the  strait.  At  night 
the  lights  of  many  fires  glowed  from  the  shores  of  this  land, 
which  Magellan  named  Tierra  del  Fuego— Land  of  Fires.  He 
supposed  that  these  were  the  near  shores  of  that  great  land 
which  the  theoretical  geographers  had  already  decided  should 
lie  to  the  south. 

Many  voyagers  after  Magellan  reported  land  they  assumed  to 
be  outlying  regions  of  the  sought-for  continent,  but  all  proved  to 
be  islands.  The  locations  of  some,  like  Bouvet,  were  so  indefi¬ 
nitely  described  that  they  were  found  and  lost  again  many  times 


202 


Man  and  the  Sea  about  Him 


before  being  definitely  fixed  on  maps.  Kerguelen  believed  firmly 
that  the  bleak,  forbidding  land  he  discovered  in  1772  was  the 
Southern  Continent  and  so  reported  it  to  the  French  govern¬ 
ment.  When,  on  a  later  voyage,  he  learned  that  he  had  found 
merely  another  island,  Kerguelen  unhappily  named  it  ‘Isle  of 
Desolation/  Later  geographers,  however,  gave  his  own  name 
to  it. 

Discovery  of  the  southern  land  was  one  of  the  objects  of  Cap¬ 
tain  Cook’s  voyages,  but  instead  of  a  continent,  he  discovered  an 
ocean.  By  making  an  almost  complete  circumnavigation  of  the 
globe  in  high  southern  latitudes,  Cook  revealed  the  existence  of 
a  stormy  ocean  running  completely  around  the  earth  south  of 
Africa,  Australia,  and  South  America.  Perhaps  he  believed  that 
the  islands  of  the  South  Sandwich  group  were  part  of  the  Ant¬ 
arctic  mainland,  but  it  is  by  no  means  sure  that  he  was  the  first 
to  see  these  or  other  islands  of  the  Antarctic  Ocean.  American 
sealers  had  quite  possibly  been  there  before  him,  yet  this  chapter 
of  Antarctic  exploration  contains  many  blank  pages.  The  Yankee 
sealers  did  not  want  their  competitors  to  find  the  rich  sealing 
grounds,  and  they  kept  the  details  of  their  voyages  secret.  Evi¬ 
dently  they  had  operated  in  the  vicinity  of  the  outer  Antarctic 
islands  for  many  years  before  the  beginning  of  the  nineteenth 
century,  because  most  of  the  fur  seals  in  these  waters  had  been 
exterminated  by  1820.  It  was  in  this  year  that  the  Antarctic  con¬ 
tinent  was  first  sighted,  by  Captain  N.  B.  Palmer  in  command 
of  the  Hero ,  one  of  a  fleet  of  eight  sealers  from  Connecticut 
ports.  A  century  later,  explorers  were  still  making  fresh  discov¬ 
eries  about  the  nature  of  that  Southern  Continent,  dreamed  of 
by  the  old  geographers,  so  long  searched  for,  then  branded  a 
myth,  and  finally  established  as  one  of  the  great  continental 
masses  of  the  earth. 

At  the  opposite  pole,  meanwhile,  the  dream  of  a  northern 
passage  to  the  riches  of  Asia  lured  one  expedition  after  another 
into  the  frozen  seas  of  the  north.  Cabot,  Frobisher,  and  Davis 
sought  the  passage  to  the  northwest,  failed,  and  turned  back. 
Hudson  was  left  by  a  mutinous  crew  to  die  in  an  open  boat.  Sir

John  Franklin  set  out  with  the  Erebus  and  Terror  in  1845, 
apparently  entered  the  labyrinth  of  Arctic  islands  by  what  later 
proved  a  feasible  route,  but  then  lost  his  ships  and  perished  with 
all  his  men.  Later  rescue  ships  coming  from  east  and  west  met 

in  Melville  Sound  and  thus  the  Northwest  Passage  was  estab¬ 
lished. 

Meanwhile  there  had  been  repeated  efforts  to  find  a  way  to 
India  by  sailing  eastward  through  the  Arctic  Sea.  The  Norwe¬ 
gians  seem  to  have  hunted  walruses  in  the  White  Sea  and  had 
probably  reached  the  coasts  of  Novaya  Zemlya  by  the  time  of 
Ottar;  they  may  have  discovered  Spitsbergen  in  1194,  although 
this  is  usually  credited  to  Barents  in  1596.  The  Russians  had 
hunted  seals  in  the  polar  seas  as  early  as  the  sixteenth  century, 
and  whalers  began  to  operate  out  of  Spitsbergen  soon  after  Hud¬ 
son,  in  1607,  called  attention  to  the  great  number  of  whales  in 
the  sea  between  Spitsbergen  and  Greenland.  So  at  least  the 
threshold  of  the  ice-filled  northern  ocean  was  known  when  the 
British  and  Dutch  traders  began  their  desperate  attempt  to  find 
a  sea  road  north  of  Europe  and  Asia.  There  were  many  attempts, 
but  few  got  beyond  the  coasts  of  Novaya  Zemlya;  the  sixteenth 
and  seventeenth  centuries  were  marked  by  the  wreckage  of  hopes 
as  well  as  of  vessels,  and  by  the  death  of  such  brilliant  navi¬ 
gators  as  William  Barents  under  the  hardships  met  by  expedi¬ 
tions  ill  prepared  for  arctic  winters.  Finally  the  effort  was  aban¬ 
doned.  It  was  not  until  1879,  after  the  practical  need  for  such 
a  passage  had  largely  disappeared,  that  Baron  Nordenskiold,  in 
the  Swedish  Vega ,  passed  from  Gothenburg  to  Bering  Strait. 

So,  little  by  little,  through  many  voyages  undertaken  over 
many  centuries,  the  fog  and  the  frightening  obscurity  of  the  un¬ 
known  were  lifted  from  all  the  surface  of  the  Sea  of  Darkness. 
IIow  did  they  accomplish  it— those  first  voyagers,  who  had  not 
even  the  simplest  instruments  of  navigation,  who  had  never  seen 
a  nautical  chart,  to  whom  the  modern  miracles  of  loran,  radar, 
and  sonic  sounding  would  have  been  fantasies  beyond  belief? 
Who  was  the  first  man  to  use  a  mariner’s  compass,  and  what 
were  the  embryonic  beginnings  of  the  charts  and  the  sailing

directions  that  are  taken  for  granted  today?  None  of  these  ques¬ 
tions  can  be  answered  with  finality;  we  know  only  enough  to 
want  to  know  more. 

Of  the  methods  of  those  secretive  master  mariners,  the  Phoe¬ 
nicians,  we  cannot  even  guess.  We  have  more  basis  for  con¬ 
jecture  about  the  Polynesians,  for  we  can  study  their  descendants 
today,  and  those  who  have  done  so  find  hints  of  the  methods 
that  led  the  ancient  colonizers  of  the  Pacific  on  their  course 
from  island  to  island.  Certainly  they  seem  to  have  followed  the 
stars,  which  burned  brightly  in  the  heavens  over  those  calm 
Pacific  regions,  which  are  so  unlike  the  stormy  and  fog-bound 
northern  seas.  The  Polynesians  considered  the  stars  as  moving 
bands  of  light  that  passed  across  the  inverted  pit  of  the  sky,  and 
they  sailed  toward  the  stars  which  they  knew  passed  over  the 
islands  of  their  destination.  All  the  language  of  the  sea  was 
understood  by  them:  the  varying  color  of  the  water,  the  haze 
of  surf  breaking  on  rocks  yet  below  the  horizon,  and  the  cloud 
patches  that  hang  over  every  islet  of  the  tropic  seas  and  some¬ 
times  seem  even  to  reflect  the  color  of  a  lagoon  within  a  coral 
atoll. 

Students  of  primitive  navigation  believe  that  the  migrations 
of  birds  had  meaning  for  the  Polynesians,  and  that  they  learned 
much  from  watching  the  flocks  that  gathered  each  year  in  the 
spring  and  fall,  launched  out  over  the  ocean,  and  returned  later 
out  of  the  emptiness  into  which  they  had  vanished.  Harold 
Gatty  believes  the  Hawaiians  may  have  found  their  islands  by 
following  the  spring  migration  of  the  golden  plover  from  Tahiti 
to  the  Hawaiian  chain,  as  the  birds  returned  to  the  North  Amer¬ 
ican  mainland.  He  has  also  suggested  that  the  migratory  path  of 
the  shining  cuckoo  may  have  guided  other  colonists  from  the 
Solomons  to  New  Zealand. 

Tradition  and  written  records  tell  us  that  primitive  navigators 
often  carried  with  them  birds  which  they  would  release  and  fol¬ 
low  to  land.  The  frigate  bird  or  man-of-war  bird  was  the  shore¬ 
sighting  bird  of  the  Polynesians  (even  in  recent  times  it  has  been 
used  to  carry  messages  between  islands),  and  in  the  Norse  Sagas 
we  have  an  account  of  the  use  of  havens’  by  Floki  Vilgerdarson 


The  Encircling  Sea

to  show  him  the  way  to  Iceland,  ‘since  seafaring  men  had  no 
loadstone  at  that  time  in  the  north  . . .  Thence  he  sailed  out  to 
sea  with  the  three  ravens . . .  And  when  he  let  loose  the  first  it 
flew  back  astern.  The  second  flew  up  into  the  air  and  back  to  the 

ship.  The  third  flew  forward  over  the  prow,  where  they  found 
land/ 

In  thick  and  foggy  weather,  according  to  repeated  statements 
in  the  Sagas,  the  Norsemen  drifted  for  days  without  knowing 
where  they  were.  Then  they  often  had  to  rely  on  observing  the 
flight  of  birds  to  judge  the  direction  of  land.  The  Landnamabok 
says  that  on  the  course  from  Norway  to  Greenland  the  voyager 
should  keep  far  enough  to  the  south  of  Iceland  to  have  birds  and 
whales  from  there.  In  shallow  waters  it  appears  that  the  Norse¬ 
men  took  some  sort  of  soundings,  for  the  Historia  Norwegiae 
records  that  Ingolf  and  Hjorleif  found  Iceland  ‘by  probing  the 
waves  with  the  lead/ 

The  first  mention  of  the  use  of  the  magnetic  needle  as  a  guide 
to  mariners  occurs  in  the  twelfth  century  after  Christ,  but  as 
much  as  a  century  later  scholars  were  expressing  doubt  that 
sailors  would  entrust  their  lives  to  an  instrument  so  obviously 
invented  by  the  devil.  There  is  fair  evidence,  however,  that  the 
compass  was  in  use  in  the  Mediterranean  about  the  end  of  the 
twelfth  century,  and  in  northern  Europe  within  the  next  hun¬ 
dred  years. 

For  navigating  the  known  seas,  there  had  been  the  equivalent 
of  our  modern  Sailing  Directions  for  a  great  many  centuries 
before  this.  The  portolano  and  the  peripli  guided  the  mariners 
of  antiquity  about  the  Mediterranean  and  Black  seas.  The  por¬ 
tolano  were  harbor-finding  charts,  designed  to  accompany  the 
coast  pilots  or  peripli ,  and  it  is  not  known  which  of  the  two  was 
developed  first.  The  Periplus  of  Scylax  is  the  oldest  and  most 
complete  of  these  ancient  Coast  Pilots  that  have  survived  the 
hazards  of  the  intervening  centuries  and  are  preserved  for  us. 
The  chart  which  presumably  accompanied  it  no  longer  exists, 
but  the  two  were,  in  effect,  a  guide  to  navigation  of  the  Mediter¬ 
ranean  in  the  fourth  or  fifth  century  b.c. 

The  periplus  called  Stadiasmus ,  or  circumnavigation  of  the 


206 


Man  and  the  Sea  about  Him 


great  sea  dates  from  about  the  fifth  century  after  Christ  but 
reads  surprisingly  like  a  modern  Pilot,  giving  distances  between 
points,  the  winds  with  which  the  various  islands  might  be  ap¬ 
proached,  and  the  facilities  for  anchorage  or  for  obtaining  fresh 
water.  So  for  example,  we  read,  'From  Hermaea  to  Leuce  Acte, 
20  stadia  hereby  lies  a  low  islet  at  a  distance  of  two  stadia  from 
the  land,  there  is  anchorage  for  cargo  boats,  to  be  put  into  with 
west  wind;  but  by  the  shore  below  the  promontory  is  a  wide 
anchoring-road  for  all  kinds  of  vessels.  Temple  of  Apollo,  a 
famous  oracle;  by  the  temple  there  is  water/ 

Lloyd  Brown,  in  his  Story  of  Maps ,  says  that  no  true  mariners’ 
chart  of  the  first  thousand  years  after  Christ  has  been  preserved 
or  is  definitely  known  to  have  existed.  This  he  ascribes  to  the 
fact  that  early  mariners  carefully  guarded  the  secrets  of  how  thev 
made  their  passages  from  place  to  place;  that  sea  charts  were 
‘keys  to  empire’  and  a  ‘way  to  wealth’  and  as  such  were  secret, 
hidden  documents.  Therefore,  because  the  earliest  specimen  of 
such  a  chart  now  extant  was  made  by  Petrus  Vesconte  in  1311 
does  not  mean  that  many  had  not  existed  before  it. 

It  was  a  Dutchman  who  produced  the  first  collection  of  navi¬ 
gational  charts  bound  together  in  book  form— Lucas  Janssz 
Waghenaer.  The  Mariner  s  Mirror  of  Waghenaer,  first  pub¬ 
lished  in  1584,  covered  the  navigation  of  the  western  coast  of 
Europe  from  the  Zuyder  Zee  to  Cadiz.  Soon  it  was  issued  in 
several  languages.  For  many  years  ‘Waggoners’  guided  Dutch, 
English,  Scandinavian,  and  German  navigators  through  eastern 
Atlantic  waters,  from  the  Canaries  to  Spitsbergen,  for  succeeding 
editions  had  extended  the  areas  covered  to  include  the  Shetland 
and  Faroe  islands  and  even  the  northern  coast  of  Russia  as  far 
as  Novaya  Zemlya. 

In  the  sixteenth  and  seventeenth  centuries,  under  the  stimulus 
of  fierce  competition  for  the  wealth  of  the  East  Indies,  the  finest 
charts  were  prepared  not  by  governmental  agencies,  but  by  pri¬ 
vate  enterprise.  The  East  India  companies  employed  their  own 
hydrographers,  prepared  secret  atlases,  and  generally  guarded 
their  knowledge  of  the  sailing  passages  to  the  East  as  one  of  the 
most  precious  secrets  of  their  trade.  But  in  1795  the  East  India 


The  Encircling  Sea 


207 

Company’s  hydrographer,  Alexander  Dalrymple,  became  official 
hydrographer  to  the  Admiralty,  and  under  his  direction  the  Brit¬ 
ish  Admiralty  began  its  survey  of  the  coasts  of  the  world  from 
which  the  modern  Admiralty  Pilots  stem. 

Shortly  thereafter  a  young  man  joined  the  United  States  Navy 
—Matthew  Fontaine  Maury.  In  only  a  few  years  Lieutenant 
Maury  was  to  make  his  influence  felt  on  navigation  all  over  the 
world,  and  was  to  write  a  book,  The  Physical  Geography  of  the 
Sea ,  which  is  now  considered  the  foundation  of  the  science  of 
oceanography.  After  a  number  of  years  at  sea,  Maury  assumed 
charge  of  the  Depot  of  Charts  and  Instruments— the  forerunner 
of  the  present  Hydrographic  Office— and  began  a  practical  study 
of  winds  and  currents  from  the  standpoint  of  the  navigator. 
Through  his  energy  and  initiative  a  world-wide  co-operative  sys¬ 
tem  was  organized.  Ships’  officers  of  all  nations  sent  in  the  logs 
of  their  voyages,  from  which  Maury  assembled  and  organized 
information,  which  he  incorporated  in  navigational  charts.  In 
return,  the  co-operating  mariner  received  copies  of  the  charts. 
Soon  Maury’s  sailing  directions  were  attracting  world  notice:  he 
had  shortened  the  passage  for  American  east-coast  vessels  to  Rio 
de  Janeiro  by  10  days,  to  Australia  by  20  days,  and  around  the 
Horn  to  California  by  30  days.  The  co-operative  exchange  of  in¬ 
formation  sponsored  by  Maury  remains  in  effect  today,  and  the 
Pilot  Charts  of  the  Hydrographic  Office,  the  lineal  descendants 
of  Maury’s  charts,  carry  the  inscription:  ‘Founded  on  the  re¬ 
searches  of  Matthew  Fontaine  Maury  while  serving  as  a  Lieu¬ 
tenant  in  the  United  States  Navy.’ 

In  the  modern  Sailing  Directions  and  Coast  Pilots  now  issued 
by  every  maritime  nation  of  the  world  we  find  the  most  com¬ 
plete  information  that  is  available  to  guide  the  navigator  over 
the  ocean.  Yet  in  these  writings  of  the  sea  there  is  a  pleasing 
blend  of  modernity  and  antiquity,  with  unmistakable  touches  by 
which  we  may  trace  their  lineage  back  to  the  sailing  directions 
of  the  sagas  or  the  peripli  of  the  ancient  Mediterranean  seamen. 

It  is  surprising,  but  pleasant,  that  sailing  directions  of  one  and 
the  same  vintage  should  contain  instructions  for  obtaining  posi¬ 
tion  by  the  use  of  loran,  and  should  also  counsel  the  navigator 


208 


Man  and  the  Sea  about  Him 


to  be  guided,  like  the  Norsemen  a  millennium  ago,  by  the  flight 
of  birds  and  the  behavior  of  whales  in  making  land  in  foggy 
weather.  In  the  Norway  Pilot  we  read  as  follows: 

[Of  Jan  Mayen  Island]  The  presence  of  sea  fowl  in  large  num¬ 
bers  will  give  an  indication  of  the  approach  to  land  and  the  noise 
of  their  rookeries  may  be  useful  in  locating  the  shore. 

[Of  Bear  Island]  The  sea  around  the  islands  teems  with  guille¬ 
mots.  These  flocks  and  the  direction  of  their  flight  on  approach¬ 
ing,  together  with  the  use  of  the  lead,  are  of  great  value  in  making 
the  island  when  it  is  foggy. 

And  the  ultra-modern  United  States  Pilot  for  Antarctica  says: 

Navigators  should  observe  the  bird  life,  for  deductions  may 
often  be  drawn  from  the  presence  of  certain  species.  Shags  are 
...  a  sure  sign  of  the  close  proximity  of  land  . . .  The  snow  petrel 
is  invariably  associated  with  ice  and  is  of  great  interest  to  mari¬ 
ners  as  an  augury  of  ice  conditions  in  their  course  . .  .  Blowing 
whales  usually  travel  in  the  direction  of  open  water. 

Sometimes  the  Pilots  for  remote  areas  of  the  sea  can  report 
only  what  the  whalers  or  sealers  or  some  old-time  fisherman  has 
said  about  the  navigability  of  a  channel  or  the  set  of  the  tidal 
currents;  or  they  must  include  a  chart  prepared  half  a  century 
ago  by  the  last  vessel  to  take  soundings  in  the  area.  Often  they 
must  caution  the  navigator  not  to  proceed  without  seeking  infor¬ 
mation  of  those  having  'local  knowledge/  In  phrases  like  these 
we  get  the  feel  of  the  unknown  and  the  mysterious  that  never 
quite  separates  itself  from  the  sea:  'It  is  said  that  there  was  once 
an  island  there . . .  such  information  as  could  be  secured  from 
reports  of  men  with  local  knowledge  . . .  their  position  has  been 
disputed  ...  a  bank  reported  by  an  old-time  sealer/ 

So  here  and  there,  in  a  few  out-of-the-way  places,  the  darkness 
of  antiquity  still  lingers  over  the  surface  of  the  waters.  But  it  is 
rapidly  being  dispelled  and  most  of  the  length  and  breadth  of 
the  ocean  is  known;  it  is  only  in  thinking  of  its  third  dimension 
that  we  can  still  apply  the  concept  of  the  Sea  of  Darkness.  It 
took  centuries  to  chart  the  surface  of  the  sea;  our  progress  in 


The  Encircling  Sea 


209 

delineating  the  unseen  world  beneath  it  seems  by  comparison 
phenomenally  rapid.  But  even  with  all  our  modern  instruments 
for  probing  and  sampling  the  deep  ocean,  no  one  now  can  say 
that  we  shall  ever  resolve  the  last,  the  ultimate  mysteries  of  the 
sea. 

In  its  broader  meaning,  that  other  concept  of  the  ancients 
remains.  For  the  sea  lies  all  about  us.  The  commerce  of  all  lands 
must  cross  it.  The  very  winds  that  move  over  the  lands  have  been 
cradled  on  its  broad  expanse  and  seek  ever  to  return  to  it.  The 
continents  themselves  dissolve  and  pass  to  the  sea,  in  grain  after 
grain  of  eroded  land.  So  the  rains  that  rose  from  it  return  again 
in  rivers.  In  its  mysterious  past  it  encompasses  all  the  dim  ori¬ 
gins  of  life  and  receives  in  the  end,  after,  it  may  be,  many 
transmutations,  the  dead  husks  of  that  same  life.  For  all  at  last 
return  to  the  sea — to  Oceanus,  the  ocean  river,  like  the  ever- 
flowing  stream  of  time,  the  beginning  and  the  end.

Our  concept  of  the  age  of  the  earth  is  constantly  undergoing 
revision  as  older  and  older  rocks  are  discovered  and  as  methods  of 
study  are  refined.  The  oldest  rocks  now  known  in  North  America 
are  in  the  Canadian  Shield  area.  Their  precise  age  has  not  been 
determined,  but  some  from  Manitoba  and  Ontario  are  believed  to 
have  been  formed  about  3  billion  years  ago.  Even  older  rocks  have 
been  discovered  in  the  Karelia  Peninsula  in  the  U.S.S.R.,  and  in 
South  Africa.  Geologists  are  generally  of  the  opinion  that  present 
concepts  of  geologic  time  will  be  considerably  lengthened  in  the 
future.  Tentative  adjustments  of  the  length  of  the  various  periods 
have  already  been  made  (see  chart,  pages  10-11)  and  the  age  of 
the  Cambrian  has  been  pushed  back  100  million  years  compared 
with  the  dating  assigned  to  it  a  decade  ago.  It  is  in  that  immense 
and  shadowy  time  that  preceded  the  Cambrian,  however,  that  the 
greatest  uncertainty  exists.  This  is  the  time  of  the  pre-fossiliferous 
rocks.  Whatever  life  may  have  inhabited  the  earth  during  that  time 
has  left  few  traces,  although  by  indirect  evidence  we  may  infer  that 
life  existed  in  some  abundance  before  its  record  was  written  in 
the  rocks. 

By  studies  of  the  rocks  themselves  geologists  have  established  a 
few  good  benchmarks  standing  out  in  those  vast  stretches  of  time 
indicated  on  the  chart  as  the  Proterozoic  and  Archeozoic  Eras. 
These  indicate  a  billion-year  age  for  the  ancient  Grenville  Moun¬ 
tains  of  eastern  North  America.  Where  these  rocks  are  exposed  at 
the  surface,  as  in  Ontario,  they  contain  large  amounts  of  graphite, 
giving  silent  testimony  to  the  abundance  of  plant  life  when  these 
rocks  were  forming,  for  plants  are  a  common  source  of  carbon. 
An  age-reading  of  1,700,000,000  years  has  been  obtained  in  the 
Penokean  Mountains  of  Minnesota  and  Ontario,  formerly  known 
to  geologists  as  the  Killarney  Mountains.  The  remains  of  these  once 
lofty  mountains  are  still  to  be  seen  as  low,  rolling  hills.  The  dis- 


212 


Appendix 


covery  of  even  older  rocks  in  Canada,  Russia,  and  Africa,  dating 
back  more  than  3  billion  years,  suggests  that  the  earth  itself  may 
have  been  formed  about  4P2  billion  years  ago. 

2.  The  Sunless  Sea ,  page  38 

Man  s  dream  of  personally  exploring  the  deepest  recesses  of  the 
sea  has  been  realized  during  the  past  decade.  Persistent  effort, 
imaginative  vision,  and  engineering  skill  have  produced  a  type  of 
underwater  craft  capable  of  withstanding  the  enormous  stresses  im¬ 
posed  by  the  greatest  depths  of  the  sea  and  of  carrying  human 
observers  into  these  realms  that  only  a  few  years  ago  would  have 
seemed  beyond  the  reach  of  man. 

The  pioneer  in  this  area  of  deep  ocean  exploration  was  Professor 
Auguste  Piccard,  the  Swiss  physicist  who  had  already  attained  fame 
through  his  ascent  into  the  stratosphere  in  a  balloon.  Professor  Pic¬ 
card  proposed  a  depth-exploring  vehicle  which,  instead  of  being 
suspended  at  the  end  of  a  cable  like  the  bathysphere,  would  move 
freely,  independent  of  control  from  the  surface.  Three  such  bathy¬ 
scaphes  (depth  boats)  have  now  been  constructed.  Observers  ride 
in  a  pressure-resisting  ball  suspended  from  a  metal  envelope  con¬ 
taining  high-octane  gasoline,  an  extremely  light,  almost  incom¬ 
pressible  fluid.  Silos  loaded  with  iron  pellets  provide  ballast;  the 
pellets  are  held  by  electromagnets,  to  be  released  by  the  touch  of 
a  button  when  the  divers  are  ready  to  return  to  the  surface.  The 
first  bathyscaphe,  provided  by  the  Fonds  National  de  la  Recherche 
Scientifique,  which  is  the  Belgian  scientific  research  fund,  was 
known  as  the  FNRS-2.  (The  FNRS-i  was  the  stratosphere  balloon, 
which  the  Fund  also  provided  for  Piccard.)  The  FNRS-2,  in  ex¬ 
perimental  unmanned  dives,  revealed  great  promise  but  also  had 
certain  defects  which  were  remedied  in  the  craft  built  later.  The 
second  bathyscaphe,  the  FNRS-3,  was  built  under  a  treaty  between 
the  Belgian  and  French  governments,  under  the  direction  of  Piccard 
and  Jacques  Cousteau.  Before  the  completion  of  this  bathyscaphe, 
Professor  Piccard  went  to  Italy  to  begin  the  building  of  a  third 
bathyscaphe,  to  be  christened  Trieste. 

The  FRNS-3  and  tbe  Trieste  made  the  history-making  descents 
of  the  1950^  that  carried  man  to  the  deepest  parts  of  the  abyss. 
In  September  1953,  Professor  Piccard  and  his  son  Jacques  descended 
in  the  Trieste  to  a  depth  of  10,395  feet  in  the  Mediterranean. 
This  was  more  than  double  the  previous  record.  Then  in  1954

two  Frenchmen  in  the  FNRS-3,  Georges  Houot  and  Pierre-Henri 
Willm,  penetrated  even  deeper  into  the  sea,  to  depths  of  13,287 
feet  in  the  open  ocean  off  Dakar  on  the  coast  of  Africa.  In  1958 
the  Trieste  was  purchased  from  the  Piccards  by  the  United  States 
Office  of  Naval  Research.  The  following  year  the  Trieste  was  taken 
to  Guam,  in  the  vicinity  of  which  lies  the  great  Mariana  Trench,  in 
which  echo  soundings  have  revealed  the  deepest  hole  now  known 
in  any  part  of  the  ocean.  On  January  23,  i960,  manned  by  Jacques 
Piccard  and  Don  Walsh,  the  Trieste  descended  to  the  bottom  of 
this  trench,  35,800  feet  (or  nearly  seven  miles)  beneath  the  surface.

Even  today  the  mystery  of  the  scattering  layer  has  not  been  com¬ 
pletely  resolved.  Through  an  ingenious  combination  of  new  tech¬ 
niques,  however,  the  picture  is  gradually  becoming  clearer.  It  now 
appears  that  at  least  in  some  areas — as  over  the  continental  shelf 
off  New  England — fishes  may  compose  a  substantial  part  of  the 
layer.  This  has  been  determined  by  studying  it  with  a  sound  source 
that  embraces  many  frequencies  (the  ordinary  echo  sounder  is  a 
single-frequency  device).  This  method  not  only  reveals  the  vertical 
migration  but  brings  out  the  fact  that  the  very  nature  of  the  scat¬ 
tering  changes  with  depth.  Such  changes  are  best  interpreted  as 
originating  in  the  swim  bladders  of  fishes,  which  are  compressed 
under  the  increasing  pressure  of  a  descent  into  deeper  levels  of  the 
sea  but  which  expand  with  ascent  toward  the  surface  and  conse¬ 
quent  lessening  of  pressure.  The  formerly  held  objection  that  fishes 
could  not  possibly  be  abundant  enough  to  account  for  the  very 
widespread  occurrence  of  the  scattering  layer  has  melted  away  in 
the  light  of  information  new  techniques  have  given  us.  It  was  for¬ 
merly  supposed  that  a  strong  echo  implied  a  very  dense  concentra¬ 
tion  of  whatever  creatures  were  returning  the  echo.  Now  it  is 
realized  that  the  tracings  recorded  by  the  echo  sounder  do  not 
necessarily  indicate  the  density  of  the  animals  in  the  scattering 
layer,  so  that  actually  a  dark  tracing  on  the  record  may  be  produced 
by  only  a  few  strong  scatterers  passing  through  the  beam  in  any 
particular  instant  of  time. 

One  of  the  study  methods  increasingly  used  during  the  1950^ 
was  an  underwater  camera  correlated  with  an  echo  sounder.  All 
pictures  of  fishes  so  obtained  have  been  accompanied  by  strong 
echoes.  None  of  these  findings  rule  out  the  possibility  that  other 


214  Appendix 

organisms  may  also  help  to  compose  the  scattering  layer.  They  do 
furnish  rather  convincing  evidence  that  fishes  compose  an  impor¬ 
tant  part  of  a  phenomenon  that,  in  all  probability,  lends  itself  to 
no  single  explanation,  but  varies  as  to  the  species  composing  it  over 
the  vast  areas  of  the  ocean.

In  1957  flriice  C.  Heezen  of  the  Lamont  Geological  Observatory 
published  a  fascinating  compilation  of  fourteen  instances  of  whales 
entangled  in  submarine  cables  between  1877  and  1955.  Ten  of 
these  accidents  occurred  off  the  Pacific  coast  of  Central  and  South 
America,  two  in  the  South  Atlantic,  one  in  the  North  Atlantic,  and 
one  in  the  Persian  Gulf.  All  entanglements  involved  sperm  whales 
and  it  is  possible  the  concentration  of  reports  off  the  coasts  of 
Ecuador  and  Peru  may  be  related  to  a  seasonal  migration  of  these 
whales.  The  greatest  depth  at  which  a  whale  was  found  entangled 
was  620  fathoms  or  nearly  two-thirds  of  a  mile.  More  whales  were 
trapped  by  cables  at  about  500  fathoms  than  at  any  other  depth, 
suggesting  that  the  natural  food  of  the  sperm  whale  may  be  con¬ 
centrated  at  about  this  level.  Two  significant  details  were  observed 
m  most  of  these  cases:  the  entanglement  occurred  near  the  site  of 
earlier  repairs  where  slack  cable  lay  on  the  bottom,  and  the  cable 
was  usually  wrapped  around  the  whale’s  jaw.  Heezen  suggests  that 
as  a  whale  skims  along  the  ocean  bottom  in  search  of  food  its  lower 
jaw  may  become  entangled  in  a  slack  loop  of  cable  lying  on  the 
bottom.  The  struggles  of  the  whale  to  free  itself  could  easily  result 
in  its  complete  entanglement  in  the  cable.

kor  years  people  have  speculated  as  to  the  function  served  by 
sound  production  on  the  part  of  marine  species.  It  has  been  known 
for  at  least  20  years  that  the  bat  finds  its  way  about  in  lightless 
caves  and  on  dark  nights  by  means  of  a  physiological  equivalent  of 
radar,  emitting  a  stream  of  high-frequency  sound,  which  returns  to 
it  as  echoes  from  any  obstructions  in  its  path.  Could  the  sounds 
produced  by  certain  fishes  and  marine  mammals  serve  a  similar  pur¬ 
pose,  aiding  inhabitants  of  deep  waters  to  swim  in  darkness  and  to 
find  prey?  Among  the  early  tape  recordings  of  underwater  sound 
obtained  by  the  Woods  Hole  Oceanographic  Institution  was  a  re¬ 
cording  of  some  mysterious  calls  that  emanated  from  waters  so 


Appendix 


21 5 

deep  as  surely  to  be  lightless.  They  were  distinguished  by  the  fact 
that  each  call  was  followed  by  a  faint  echo  of  itself,  so  that  for 
want  of  a  better  name  the  unknown  author  of  these  eerie  sounds 
was  christened  the  echo  fish.  Actual  evidence  of  anything  similar 
to  the  bat’s  echo  location  or  echo  ranging  has  come  only  recently 
in  the  form  of  ingenious  experiments  performed  on  captive  por¬ 
poises  by  W.  N.  Kellogg  of  Florida  State  University.  Dr.  Kellogg 
finds  that  the  porpoises  emit  streams  of  underwater  sound  pulses 
by  which  they  are  able  to  swim  accurately  through  a  field  of  ob¬ 
structions  without  collision.  They  could  do  this  in  water  too  turbid 
for  vision  or  in  darkness.  When  the  experimenters  introduced  any 
object  into  the  tank  the  porpoises  gave  forth  bursts  of  sound  signals 
by  which  the  animals  appeared  to  be  trying  to  locate  the  object. 
Splashing  on  the  surface,  as  from  a  hose  or  a  shower  of  rain,  “pro¬ 
duced^  great  disturbance,  loud  sound  signals,  undulating  porpoise 
'alarm’  whistles,  and  'flight’  swimming  reactions.”  When  food  fish 
were  introduced  into  the  tank  under  such  circumstances  that  they 
could  not  be  located  visually,  the  porpoises  located  them  by  streams 
of  sound  signals,  turning  their  heads  to  right  and  left  as  the  return¬ 
ing  echoes  allowed  them  to  fix  the  exact  location  of  their  target.

Latimeria  was  identified  as  a  coelacanth,  or  one  of  an  incredibly 
ancient  group  of  fishes  that  first  appeared  in  the  seas  some  300 
million  years  ago.  Rocks  representing  the  next  200  million  and 
more  years  of  earth  history  yielded  fossil  coelacanths;  then,  in  the 
Cretaceous,  the  record  of  these  fishes  came  to  an  end.  The  reappear¬ 
ance  of  a  coelacanth  as  a  live  fish  off  South  Africa  was  at  first 
considered  a  mysterious  and  extraordinary  incident,  not  likely  to 
be  repeated.  An  ichthyologist  in  South  Africa,  Professor  J.  L.  B. 
Smith,  did  not  share  this  view.  Believing  there  must  be  other 
coelacanths  in  the  sea,  he  began  a  patient  search  that  went  on 
14  years  before  it  was  successful.  Then,  in  December  1952,  a  second 
fish  of  this  group  was  captured  near  the  island  of  Anjouan,  off 
the  northwestern  tip  of  Madagascar.  The  search  was  then  taken  up 
by  Professor  J.  Millot,  Director  of  the  Research  Institute  in  Mada¬ 
gascar.  By  1958  Professor  Millot  had  obtained  ten  more  specimens, 
consisting  of  seven  males  and  three  females. 

A  plausible  explanation  of  the  sixty-million-year  gap  in  the  oc¬ 
currence  of  fossil  coelacanths  has  been  put  forward  by  Dr.  Bobb 


2l6 


Appendix 


Schaeffer  of  the  American  Museum  of  Natural  History.  Dr.  Schaeffer 
points  out  that  the  earliest  coelacanths,  from  pre-Jurassic  time, 
seem  to  have  inhabited  a  variety  of  environments,  including  fresh¬ 
water  swamps  as  well  as  seas.  From  the  Jurassic  to  the  present  time, 
on  the  other  hand,  they  seem  to  have  been  exclusively  marine.  At 
the  close  of  the  Cretaceous,  the  great  withdrawal  of  the  sea  from 
the  continental  areas  it  had  overflowed  may  have  confined  the  coe- 
lacanths  to  the  permanent  ocean  basins.  There,  in  the  bottom  sedi¬ 
ments,  their  fossils  would  be  so  inaccessible  that  the  chance  of  their 
discovery  would  be  exceedingly  remote.

The  range  of  echo-sounding  instruments  has  now  been  so  greatly 
extended  that  under  ideal  conditions  the  most  powerful  of  them 
are  capable  of  sounding  the  maximum  depths  of  the  sea.  Factors 
such  as  the  nature  of  the  underlying  bottom  and  conditions  in  the 
intervening  water  layers  influence  the  effectiveness  with  which  the 
sounding  devices  operate  under  actual  conditions  at  sea.  Never¬ 
theless,  the  potential  range  necessary  for  charting  all  parts  of  the 
sea  is  now  at  the  command  of  oceanographers.

In  the  ten  years  that  have  elapsed  since  this  account  of  the 
canyons  was  written  much  more  has  been  learned  about  them,  but 
it  may  still  be  said  that  there  is  no  general  agreement  about  their 
origin.  Many  of  the  resources  of  the  modern  oceanographer  have 
been  brought  to  bear  on  the  problem.  Divers  have  engaged  in  direct 
exploration  of  the  shallow  heads  of  some  of  the  California  canyons, 
collecting  samples  of  their  walls  and  photographing  them.  Other 
canyons  have  been  studied  by  oceanographers  using  deep-sea  corers 
or  dredges  to  obtain  samples  of  rocks  and  sediments.  Precision 
depth  recorders  have  given  much  new  information  about  their 
shapes.  As  a  result  of  these  studies  it  is  now  known  that  there  are 
at  least  five  types  of  canyons,  so  different  in  their  characteristics 
that  almost  certainly  they  have  different  origins.  No  single  theory 
may  be  expected  to  explain  all  of  them.  Professor  Francis  S. 
Shepard,  the  marine  geologist  who  originally  put  forward  the  theory 
that  the  canyons  had  been  cut  by  rivers  and  later  submerged,  now 
feels  this  explanation  is  adequate  for  some  canyons  but  not  for 
others.  For  example,  some  marine  valleys,  trough-shaped  and 
straight-walled  and  occurring  in  areas  where  the  earth’s  crust  is 


Appendix 


217 

in  a  sate  of  unrest,  probably  represent  a  fault  or  fracture  of  the 
rocky  floor.  The  theory  that  some  of  the  canyons  have  been  cut  by 
vast  sediment  flows  called  turbidity  currents  has  gained  support  as 
a  result  of  new  concepts  of  dynamic  activity  on  the  floor  of  the 
sea.  Further  detailed  study  of  all  types  of  these  extraordinarily 
fascinating  features  of  the  sea  floor  should  not  only  clarify  their  own 

history  but  add  greatly  to  our  understanding  of  the  history  of  the 
earth.

Somewhat  greater  depths  have  more  recently  been  recorded  in 
the  Mariana  Trench  oft  the  island  of  Guam,  the  trench  into 
which  the  bathyscaphe  Trieste  made  its  record-breaking  descent 
to  the  bottom.  In  this  trench  the  Challenger  in  1951  recorded  a 
depth  of  10,863  meters  or  about  6.7  miles.  Since  the  exact  location 
of  the  Challenger  echo  sounding  was  given,  this  depth  is  capable  of 
verification  and  so  is  regarded  as  the  maximum  depth  of  which 
we  have  authentic  record.  In  1958,  however,  Russian  scientists 
aboard  the  Vitiaz  reported  a  finding  of  slightly  greater  depths 
(11,034  meters  or  6.8  miles)  also  in  the  Mariana  Trench,  but  at 
an  unspecified  location. 

10.  Hidden  Lands,  page  63 

The  supposition  that  the  Atlantic  Ridge  may  extend  across  the 
Arctic  basin  has  been  confirmed  in  exciting  new  developments  in 
marine  geology.  Indeed,  it  is  now  suggested  by  some  geologists 
that  the  whole  mid-Atlantic  ridge  is  part  of  a  continuous  range  of 
mountains  that  runs  for  40,000  miles  across  the  bottom  of  the 
Atlantic,  the  Arctic,  the  Pacific,  and  the  Indian  Oceans  (see 
Preface ) . 

As  for  the  exploration  of  the  Arctic  basin  itself — the  charting 
of  details  so  long  unknown  and  merely  guessed  at — the  revolution¬ 
ary  development  that  made  it  possible  to  substitute  fact  for  theory 
was  the  use  of  American  nuclear-powered  submarines  to  pass  be¬ 
neath  the  ice  cover  and  directly  explore  the  depths  of  this  ocean. 

In  1957  the  Nautilus  (bearing  the  same  name  as  Wilkin's  con¬ 
ventional  submarine)  first  penetrated  beneath  Arctic  ice  in  a  pre¬ 
liminary  exploration  designed  to  discover  whether  it  was  feasible 
to  explore  these  regions  by  submarines.  The  Nautilus  remained 
submerged  for  74  hours  and  covered  a  distance  of  almost  1000 
miles.  A  vast  amount  of  data  was  collected,  including  depth  sound- 


2l8 


Appendix 


ings  and  measurements  of  the  thickness  of  the  overlying  ice.  Then 
in  1958  the  Nautilus  crossed  the  entire  Arctic  basin  from  Point 
Barrow  in  Alaska  to  the  North  Pole  and  thence  to  the  Atlantic. 
In  the  course  of  this  historic  voyage  it  made  the  first  continuously 
recorded  echo-sounder  profile  across  the  center  of  the  Arctic  basin. 
Other  nuclear  submarines  have  subsequently  contributed  to  our 
knowledge  of  the  Arctic.  It  is  now  clear,  from  the  work  of  the 
nuclear  submarines  and  from  other,  more  conventional  explorations, 
that  the  bottom  topography  of  the  Arctic  Ocean  is  for  the  most 
part  that  of  a  normal  oceanic  basin,  with  flat  abyssal  plains,  scat' 
tered  sea  mounts,  and  rugged  mountains.  The  greatest  depth  so 
far  discovered  is  somewhat  more  than  three  miles.  The  shelf  break 
(from  which  a  steeper  descent  begins)  falls  at  the  unusually  shal¬ 
low  depth  of  35  fathoms  off  Alaska.  From  samplings  by  coring 
tubes  and  dredges  and  from  deep-sea  photography  it  was  discovered 
during  the  International  Geophysical  Year  that  the  bottom  is  widely 
covered  with  rocks,  pebbles,  and  shells,  the  latter  chiefly  of  shallow- 
water  forms.  The  present  ice  cover  seems  to  be  carrying  little  or 
no  material  such  as  rock  fragments  and  sand,  so  the  material  now 
found  in  bottom  samples  must  have  come  from  ice  rafted  in  from 
surrounding  continents  during  some  past  geologic  time,  when  the 
Arctic  was  relatively  open  water. 

Russian  scientists,  who  have  done  rather  extensive  work  in  marine 
biology,  obtained  interesting  data  which  seem  to  disprove  Nansen's 
earlier  belief  that  the  waters  of  the  central  Arctic  are  extremely 
poor  in  both  plant  and  animal  life.  Data  collected  from  the  drift¬ 
ing  station  “North  Pole"  indicate  that  both  plant  and  animal 
plankton  in  great  variety  exist  in  the  region  of  the  Pole.  Little- 
studied  organisms  develop  on  the  surface  of  the  ice;  these  contain 
much  fat  and  tint  the  ice  shades  of  yellow  and  red.  Diatoms  are 
not  found  on  the  surface  of  the  ice  but  develop  (along  with  other 
plankton)  in  the  lakes  that  form  on  the  surface  of  the  ice  as  it 
melts.  By  absorbing  a  great  amount  of  energy  from  the  sun,  the 
abundant  diatom  colonies  contribute  to  further  melting  of  the  ice 
cover.  The  wealth  of  plankton  during  the  Arctic  summer  attracts 
numbers  of  birds  and  various  mammals.

Now  that  the  sediments  have  been  measured  over  much  greater 
areas  of  the  ocean  floor,  the  reaction  of  oceanographers  is  one  of 
considerable  amazement — but  their  surprise  concerns  the  fact  that 


Appendix 


219 

on  the  whole  the  mantle  of  sediments  is  so  much  thinner  than 
related  facts  would  lead  them  to  expect.  Over  vast  areas  of  the 
Pacific  the  average  thickness  of  the  sediments  (unconsolidated  sedi¬ 
ments  plus  sedimentary  rock)  is  only  about  a  quarter  of  a  mile.  It 
is  little  thicker  over  much  of  the  Atlantic.  (These  are  average 
figures;  some  much  deeper  deposits  of  course  exist.)  In  some  areas 
there  has  been  almost  no  sedimentation.  A  few  years  ago  several 
oceanographers  obtained  photographs  of  manganese  nodules  lying 
on  the  floor  of  the  Atlantic  at  great  depths  and  of  others  on  the 
Easter  Island  Ridge  of  the  southeast  Pacific.  Sharks’  teeth  dating 
from  the  Tertiary,  hence  possibly  as  much  as  70  million  years  old, 
sometimes  form  the  nuclei  of  these  nodules.  Certainly  their  growth, 
by  deposit  of  successive  layers  around  these  nuclei,  must  be  very 
slow.  Hans  Petterson  has  estimated  a  growth  of  about  1  mm.  per 
thousand  years.  Yet  during  the  period  these  nodules  have  lain  on 
the  ocean  floor,  sediments  deep  enough  to  cover  them  have  not 
been  accumulated. 

Some  idea  of  the  rate  of  sedimentation  during  post-glacial  time 
has  been  gained  by  observation  of  the  rate  of  radioactive  decay  of 
some  of  the  components  of  the  sediments.  If  this  sedimentation 
rate  had  prevailed  during  the  supposed  life  of  the  oceans,  the  aver¬ 
age  thickness  of  the  sediments  would  be  enormously  greater  than 
it  now  appears  to  be.  Did  much  of  the  deposited  sediments  dis¬ 
solve?  Were  most  of  the  present  land  masses  submerged  for  far 
greater  periods  than  we  now  assume,  with  consequently  long  periods 
of  slight  erosion?  These  and  other  explanations  of  the  mystery  of 
the  sediments  have  been  suggested,  but  none  seems  wholly  satisfy¬ 
ing.  Possibly  the  dramatic  project  of  boring  holes  in  the  floor  of 
the  ocean  down  to  the  Mohorovicic  discontinuity  (Project  Mohole; 
see  Preface)  will  provide  the  explanation  that  is  now  lacking.

From  the  time  of  its  establishment  up  to  i960,  the  warning 
system  has  issued  eight  alerts  warning  residents  of  the  Hawaiian 
Islands  of  the  approach  of  seismic  waves.  On  three  of  these  occa¬ 
sions,  waves  of  major  proportions  have  in  fact  struck  the  islands. 
None  have  been  so  large  or  so  destructive,  however,  as  those  of 
May  23,  i960,  which  spread  out  across  the  Pacific  from  their  place 
of  origin  in  violent  earthquakes  on  the  coast  of  Chile.  Without 
such  warning  the  loss  of  life  would  almost  certainly  have  been 
enormous.  As  soon  as  the  seismograph  at  the  Honolulu  Observatory 


I 


220  Appendix 

recorded  the  first  of  the  Chilean  quakes  the  system  went  into  opera¬ 
tion.  Reports  from  the  scattered  tide  stations  gave  ample  notice 
that  a  seismic  wave  had  formed  and  was  spreading  out  across  the 
Pacific.  By  early  news  bulletins  and  later  by  an  official  “sea  wave 
warning”  the  Observatory  alerted  residents  of  the  area  and  predicted 
the  time  the  wave  would  arrive  and  the  areas  to  be  affected. 
These  predictions  proved  to  be  accurate  within  reasonable  limits, 
and  although  property  damage  was  heavy,  loss  of  life  was  limited 
to  the  few  who  disregarded  the  warnings.  Sea  wave  activity  was 
reported  as  far  west  as  New  Zealand  and  as  far  north  as  Alaska. 
The  Japanese  coasts  were  struck  by  heavy  waves.  Although  the 
United  States  warning  system  does  not  now  include  other  nations, 
officials  at  Honolulu  sent  to  Japan  warnings  of  the  wave  which, 
unfortunately,  were  disregarded. 

The  warning  system  now  (in  i960)  consists  of  eight  seismograph 
stations  at  points  on  both  eastern  and  western  shores  of  the  Pacific 
and  on  certain  islands,  and  of  twenty  widely  scattered  wave  stations, 
four  of  which  are  equipped  with  automatic  wave  detectors.  The 
Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey  feels  that  additional  wave-reporting  tide 
stations  would  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  system.  Its  prin¬ 
cipal  defect  now,  however,  is  the  fact  that  it  is  not  possible  to 
predict  the  height  of  a  wave  as  it  reaches  any  particular  shore,  and 
therefore  the  same  alert  must  be  issued  for  all  approaching  seismic 
waves.  Research  on  methods  of  forecasting  wave  height  is  therefore 
needed.  Even  with  its  present  limitations,  however,  the  system  has 
filled  so  great  a  need  that  there  is  strong  international  interest  in 
extending  it  to  other  parts  of  the  world.

The  flood  of  ocean  waters  that  overwhelmed  the  coast  of  the 
Netherlands  on  February  1,  1953,  deserves  a  place  in  the  history  of 
great  storm  waves.  A  winter  gale  that  formed  west  of  Iceland  swept 
across  the  Atlantic  and  into  the  North  Sea.  All  its  force  was  ulti¬ 
mately  brought  to  bear  on  the  first  land  mass  to  obstruct  the  course 
of  its  center — the  southwestern  corner  of  Holland.  The  storm-driven 
waves  and  tides  battered  against  the  dikes  in  such  bitter  violence 
that  these  ancient  defenses  were  breached  in  a  hundred  places, 
through  which  the  flood  rushed  in  to  inundate  farms  and  villages. 
The  storm  struck  on  Saturday,  January  31,  and  by  midday  of  Sun¬ 
day  one-eighth  of  Holland  was  under  water.  The  toll  included 
about  half  a  million  acres  of  Holland’s  best  agricultural  land — 


Appendix 


221 


ravaged  by  water  and  permeated  with  salt— thousands  of  buildings, 
hundreds  of  thousands  of  live  stock,  and  an  estimated  1400  people! 
In  all  the  long  history  of  Holland’s  struggle  against  the  sea,  there 
has  been  no  comparable  assault  by  ocean  waters. 

14.  Hidden  Lands ,  page  135 

It  is  now  the  fashion  among  oceanographers  to  speak  of  the  Gulf 
Stream  System,  reflecting  the  discovery  that  east  of  Cape  Hatteras 
there  is  no  longer  a  continuous  river  of  warm  water  but  a  “series  of 
overlapping  currents  arranged  somewhat  like  the  shingles  on  a 
roof.”  Not  only  do  the  streams  “overlap”  but  they  are  narrow  and 
swift.  The  main  branches  of  the  stream  that  have  long  been  recog¬ 
nized  east  of  the  Grand  Banks  are  now  known  to  originate  far  to 
westward  of  the  Banks,  developing  not  as  branches  in  the  ordinary 
sense  but  as  a  series  of  new  currents,  each  to  the  north  of  the  next 
older  one. 

As  oceanographers  study  more  about  the  dynamics  of  circulation 
in  the  sea,  they  are  more  and  more  struck  by  parallels  between  the 
the  ocean  of  water  and  the  ocean  of  air.  One  of  the  leading  stu¬ 
dents  of  the  Gulf  Stream,  Columbus  Iselin,  has  commented  on  the 
branching  of  the  Stream  in  terms  of  a  fascinating  analogy:  “Much 
the  same  phenomena  seem  to  be  present  in  the  jet  streams  found 
at  high  elevations  in  the  great  belts  of  prevailing  westerly  winds 
of  mid-latitudes,”  he  says,  “although  each  atmospheric  jet  has 
greater  dimensions  than  the  overlapping  subdivision  of  the  Gulf 
Stream  System.”

One  of  the  most  exciting  recent  events  in  oceanography  was  the 
discovery  of  a  powerful  current  running  under  the  South  Equatorial 
current  but  in  the  opposite  direction.  The  core  of  the  counter  cur¬ 
rent  lies  about  300  feet  below  the  surface  (although  shallower  near 
its  eastern  terminal  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Galapagos  Islands).  This 
subsurface  current  is  about  250  miles  wide  and  it  flows  at  least 
3500  miles  eastward  along  the  equator  at  a  speed  of  about  3  knots. 
(The  speed  of  the  surface  current  is  only  about  one  knot.)  The 
existence  of  the  current  was  discovered  in  1952  by  Townsend  Crom¬ 
well  in  the  course  of  a  U.  S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  investigation 
of  methods  of  tuna  fishing.  Cromwell  observed  that  long  lines  set 
for  tuna  at  the  equator  did  not  move  westward  with  the  surface 
current,  as  would  be  expected,  but  drifted  rapidly  in  the  opposite 


222 


Appendix 


direction.  It  was  not  until  1958,  however,  that  an  extensive  survey 
of  the  current  was  made  by  the  Scripps  Institution  of  Oceanography 
and  its  impressive  dimensions  measured.  This  same  survey  gave 
further  proof  that  the  deep  circulation  of  the  ocean  is  far  more 
complicated  than  has  generally  been  realized,  for  beneath  the  swift¬ 
flowing  eastward  current  was  still  another,  flowing  to  the  west.  In 
only  the  uppermost  half  mile  of  Pacific  equatorial  waters,  there¬ 
fore,  there  are  three  great  rivers  of  water,  one  above  the  other,  each 
flowing  on  its  own  course  independent  of  the  other.  When  such 
surveys  can  be  extended  all  the  way  to  the  floor  of  the  ocean  an 
even  more  complex  picture  will  undoubtedly  be  revealed. 

Only  a  year  before  the  detailed  charting  of  this  Pacific  current, 
British  and  American  oceanographers  discovered  a  south-flowing 
counter  current  running  from  the  North  to  the  South  Atlantic 
under  the  Gulf  Stream  and  the  Brazil  Current.  The  techniques  that 
make  such  discoveries  possible  have  only  very  recently  become 
available  to  oceanographers.  As  their  use  becomes  more  widespread 
our  almost  complete  ignorance  of  the  deep  circulation  of  the  ocean 
will  be  dispelled. 

16.  The  Global  Thermostat ,  page  166 

During  the  1950^  enormous  advances  were  made  in  the  develop¬ 
ment  of  instruments  for  the  recording  of  water  temperatures.  A 
continuous  recording  of  water  temperatures  to  a  depth  of  several 
hundred  feet  may  be  obtained  by  towing  a  thermistor  chain  behind 
a  vessel.  The  electronic  bathythermograph  is  potentially  capable 
of  obtaining  temperatures  at  any  depth,  depending  on  the  length 
of  cable  available.  It  is  a  vast  improvement  over  the  original  bathy¬ 
thermograph  because  a  recorder  on  deck  traces  a  continuous  graph 
of  the  temperatures  being  registered  while  the  vessel  is  under  way. 
An  even  more  revolutionary  development  in  the  study  of  sea  tem¬ 
peratures  is  the  airborne  radiation  thermometer  which,  while  flown 
above  the  sea,  registers  the  surface  temperature  with  an  accuracy 
of  a  fraction  of  a  degree.  Oceanographers  regard  this  instrument 
as  still  in  the  developmental  stage,  with  further  refinement  of  ac¬ 
curacy  possible.  However,  in  such  work  as  tracing  the  edge  of  the 
Gulf  Stream  these  airborne  thermometers  have  already  proven 
themselves  enormously  useful.  During  a  i960  survey  of  the  Gulf 
Stream  conducted  by  the  Woods  Hole  Oceanographic  Institution, 
a  low-flying  plane  covered  some  30,000  miles,  obtaining  surface 
temperatures  in  various  areas  of  the  Stream.

Some  of  the  most  rewarding  sources  of  information  about  the  sea 
are  the  Sailing  Directions  of  the  U.  S.  Hydrographic  Office  (for 
waters  outside  of  the  United  States)  and  the  Coast  Pilots  of  the 
U.  S.  Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey  (for  United  States  shores) .  Besides 
giving  detailed  accounts  of  the  coastlines  and  coastal  waters  of  the 
world,  these  books  are  repositories  of  fascinating  information  on 
icebergs  and  sea  ice,  storms,  and  fog  at  sea.  Some  approach  the 
character  of  regional  geographies.  Those  dealing  with  remote  and 
inaccessible  coasts  are  especially  interesting.  They  may  be  purchased 
from  the  issuing  agency.  The  British  Admiralty  publishes  a  similar 
series,  as  do  the  appropriate  authorities  of  most  maritime  nations.
